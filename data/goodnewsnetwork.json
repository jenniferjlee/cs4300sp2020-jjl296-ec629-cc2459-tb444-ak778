But no significant associations emerged for overall stroke risk and water temperature.\n\nCHECK OUT: These are the 3 Most Promising Longevity Supplements From Scientific Research So Far\n\nAfter excluding those participants who developed cardiovascular disease within 5 or 10 years of the start of the study, the associations found weren\u2019t quite as strong, but nevertheless still remained statistically significant.\n\nThis is an observational study, and as such, can\u2019t establish cause, added to which changes in bathing frequency weren\u2019t tracked during the monitoring period. The typical style of Japanese bathing also includes immersion to shoulder height, and this may be a critical factor.\n\nBut, say the researchers, previously published research has pointed to a link between heat exposure and cardiovascular disease prevention: this is because the effects of heat on the body are not dissimilar to those of exercise.\n\nRELATED: Largest Study of Its Kind Identifies the Surprising Health Benefits of Fasting Every Other Day\n\n\u201cWe found that frequent tub bathing was significantly associated with a lower risk of hypertension, suggesting that a beneficial effect of tub bathing on risk of [cardiovascular disease] may in part be due to a reduced risk of developing hypertension,\u201d write the researchers.\n\nThey acknowledge that taking a hot bath is not without its risk, particularly if the temperature is too high, a point that is taken up by Dr. Andrew Felix Burden in a linked editorial.\n\nReprinted from BMJ\n\nBe Sure And Share This Heart-Handy Research With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch Farmer Use His Tractor to Plow Massive Tribute to Healthcare Workers into His Field", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/farmer-plows-tribute-to-nhs-workers-into-his-field/", "date": "2020-4-8", "transcript": "A talented farmer has created his own heartwarming tribute to the British National Health System (NHS) by using his tractor to plough a giant rainbow into one of his fields.\n\n33-year-old Jack Pantall used an aerial drone camera connected to his phone in order to map out the huge image of the NHS logo and the \u201cStay Safe\u201d rainbow in appreciation for Britain\u2019s healthcare workers battling the COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nThe massive image measures in at 60 meters (196 feet) tall and 152 meters (500 feet) wide on his farm near Staunton-on-Wye in Herefordshire.\n\nPantall also managed to capture drone footage of himself creating the masterpiece, which took just 16 minutes to complete.\n\nMORE: New Jersey Teens Take Matters into Their Own Hands to Help First Responders and Small Businesses Amidst COVID-19 Crisis\n\nThe dad-of-two said he wanted to show his support for all of the NHS heroes\u2014particularly since his 31-year-old brother Harry is a paramedic and his sister-in-law works as a doctor.\n\n\u201cI had one field left I could use before my spring planting finished so I decided to do it as soon as a I could,\u201d said Pantall. \u201cMy brother and I had been thinking about it and we saw some other people showing their appreciation in different ways. He said, \u2018yeah why not let\u2019s do it\u2019.\n\n\u201cSomeone else in Exeter had done #NHS into some corn so we were thinking of something more original. My brother suggested putting the Stay Safe rainbow over the top. We decided to give it a go and the worst-case scenario was that it wouldn\u2019t come out right.\n\n\u201cThankfully, however, it did. It turned out beautifully.\n\n\u201cMy drone connects to my phone so I was watching my phone screen \u2026 to see how it was coming out while I was doing it,\u201d Pantall recalled. \u201cSo the video you\u2019re watching is how I was able to draw it.\n\nLOOK: College Student Has Been Sewing Free Face Masks For Communicating With Hearing-Impaired Folks\n\n\u201cI was driving around trying to get it done in a hurry because the drone battery only lasts about 20 minutes and I had to be relatively quick on it,\u201d he added. \u201cI managed to complete it in about 16 minutes, which was just in time, really.\u201d\n\nThe rainbow has become a symbol of support for people wanting to show solidarity with health workers on the front lines of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cMy gesture was just something we thought that we could do down at the field. It\u2019s just us showing a small amount of appreciation,\u201d says Pantall. \u201cAt the very least it brings a smile to people\u2019s faces and makes them know we are thinking of them.\u201d\n\nIn addition to broadcasting his message of support to NHS workers, Pantall has also set up a JustGiving page to support hospital staffers\u2014and he hopes his stunt can help raise money and spirits.\n\n\u201cThe NHS workers are the main ones we must thank because they\u2019re right in amongst it,\u201d said Pantall. \u201cIt was all just to say a massive thank you to them.\n\nMORE: Man Uses His Savings to Fill Up Gas Tanks For Dozens of Nurses Heading to Nearby Hospital\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got various friends who live next to us who are all nurses, resuscitation nurses, so they are in the mix of it.

But no significant associations emerged for overall stroke risk and water temperature.\n\nCHECK OUT: These are the 3 Most Promising Longevity Supplements From Scientific Research So Far\n\nAfter excluding those participants who developed cardiovascular disease within 5 or 10 years of the start of the study, the associations found weren\u2019t quite as strong, but nevertheless still remained statistically significant.\n\nThis is an observational study, and as such, can\u2019t establish cause, added to which changes in bathing frequency weren\u2019t tracked during the monitoring period. The typical style of Japanese bathing also includes immersion to shoulder height, and this may be a critical factor.\n\nBut, say the researchers, previously published research has pointed to a link between heat exposure and cardiovascular disease prevention: this is because the effects of heat on the body are not dissimilar to those of exercise.\n\nRELATED: Largest Study of Its Kind Identifies the Surprising Health Benefits of Fasting Every Other Day\n\n\u201cWe found that frequent tub bathing was significantly associated with a lower risk of hypertension, suggesting that a beneficial effect of tub bathing on risk of [cardiovascular disease] may in part be due to a reduced risk of developing hypertension,\u201d write the researchers.\n\nThey acknowledge that taking a hot bath is not without its risk, particularly if the temperature is too high, a point that is taken up by Dr. Andrew Felix Burden in a linked editorial.\n\nReprinted from BMJ\n\nBe Sure And Share This Heart-Handy Research With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch Farmer Use His Tractor to Plow Massive Tribute to Healthcare Workers into His Field", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/farmer-plows-tribute-to-nhs-workers-into-his-field/", "date": "2020-4-8", "transcript": "A talented farmer has created his own heartwarming tribute to the British National Health System (NHS) by using his tractor to plough a giant rainbow into one of his fields.\n\n33-year-old Jack Pantall used an aerial drone camera connected to his phone in order to map out the huge image of the NHS logo and the \u201cStay Safe\u201d rainbow in appreciation for Britain\u2019s healthcare workers battling the COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nThe massive image measures in at 60 meters (196 feet) tall and 152 meters (500 feet) wide on his farm near Staunton-on-Wye in Herefordshire.\n\nPantall also managed to capture drone footage of himself creating the masterpiece, which took just 16 minutes to complete.\n\nMORE: New Jersey Teens Take Matters into Their Own Hands to Help First Responders and Small Businesses Amidst COVID-19 Crisis\n\nThe dad-of-two said he wanted to show his support for all of the NHS heroes\u2014particularly since his 31-year-old brother Harry is a paramedic and his sister-in-law works as a doctor.\n\n\u201cI had one field left I could use before my spring planting finished so I decided to do it as soon as a I could,\u201d said Pantall. \u201cMy brother and I had been thinking about it and we saw some other people showing their appreciation in different ways.

After researchers pinpointed the spot in her brain that would benefit from stimulation, Lehman underwent the therapy.\n\n\u201cBy the third round, the chatter started to ease,\u201d she said. \u201cBy lunch, I could look my husband in the eye. With each session, the chatter got less and less until it was completely quiet.\n\n\u201cThat was the most peace there\u2019s been in my brain since I was 16 and started down the path to bipolar disorder.\u201d\n\nLISTEN: Neuroscientists Discover a Song That Reduces Anxiety By 65%\n\nIn transcranial magnetic stimulation, electric currents from a magnetic coil placed on the scalp excite a region of the brain implicated in depression. The treatment, as approved by the FDA, requires six weeks of once-daily sessions. Only about half of patients who undergo this treatment improve, and only about a third experience remission from depression.\n\nStanford researchers hypothesized that some modifications to transcranial magnetic stimulation could improve its effectiveness. Studies had suggested that a stronger dose, of 1,800 pulses per session instead of 600, would be more effective. The researchers were cautiously optimistic of the safety of the treatment, as that dose of stimulation had been used without harm in other forms of brain stimulation for neurological disorders, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nCHECK OUT: Watching Birds Near Your Home is Good For Your Mental Health\n\nOther studies suggested that accelerating the treatment would help relieve patients\u2019 depression more rapidly. With SAINT, study participants underwent 10 sessions per day of 10-minute treatments, with 50-minute breaks in between. After a day of therapy, Lehman\u2019s mood score indicated she was no longer depressed; it took up to five days for other participants. On average, three days of the therapy were enough for participants to have relief from depression.\n\n\u201cThe less treatment-resistant participants are, the longer the treatment lasts,\u201d said postdoctoral scholar Eleanor Cole, a lead author of the study.\n\nStrengthening a weak connection\n\nThe researchers also conjectured that targeting the stimulation more precisely would improve the treatment\u2019s effectiveness. In transcranial magnetic stimulation, the treatment is aimed at the location where most people\u2019s dorsolateral prefrontal cortex lies. This region regulates executive functions, such as selecting appropriate memories and inhibiting inappropriate responses.\n\nFor SAINT, the researchers used magnetic-resonance imaging of brain activity to locate not only the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but a particular subregion within it. They pinpointed the subregion in each participant that has a relationship with the subgenual cingulate, a part of brain that is overactive in people experiencing depression.\n\nMORE: Next Time You\u2019re Feeling Stressed or Anxious, This Study Says You Should Play Tetris\n\nIn people who are depressed, the connection between the two regions is weak, and the subgenual cingulate becomes overactive, said Keith Sudheimer, clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and a senior author of the study. Stimulating the subregion of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex reduces activity in the subgenual cingulate, he said.\n\nTo test safety, the researchers evaluated the participants\u2019 cognitive function before and after treatment. They found no negative side effects; in fact, they discovered that the participants\u2019 ability to switch between mental tasks and to solve problems had improved\u2014a typical outcome for people who are no longer depressed.\n\nRELATED: Managing Your Gut Bacteria Shown to Alleviate Anxiety, Says New Research\n\nOne month after the therapy, 60% of participants were still in remission from depression. Follow-up studies are underway to determine the duration of the antidepressant effects.\n\nThe researchers plan to study the effectiveness of SAINT on other conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, addiction, and autism spectrum disorders.\n\n\u2018Resilient and stable\u2019\n\nThe depression Lehman woke up to almost two years ago was the worst episode she had ever experienced. Today, she said, she is happy and calm.\n\nSince undergoing SAINT treatment, she has completed a bachelor\u2019s degree at the University of California-Santa Barbara; she had dropped out as a young woman when her bipolar symptoms overwhelmed her studies.\n\n\u201cI used to cry over the slightest thing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when bad things happen now, I\u2019m just resilient and stable. I\u2019m in a much more peaceful state of mind, able to enjoy the positive things in life with the energy to get things done.\u201d\n\nReprinted from Stanford University\n\nTreat Your Friends To The Positivity By Sharing The Good News To Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch Matthew McConaughey Cheer Nursing Home Residents With Rousing Games of Virtual Bingo", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/matthew-mcconaughey-cheers-nursing-home-residents-with-virtual-bingo/", "date": "2020-4-7", "transcript": "Since seniors have been shown to be particularly susceptible to the risks of COVID-19, nursing homes all over the world are taking extra care to keep their elderly residents safe in isolation.\n\nWith few activities to keep them occupied, the old Texan residents from The Enclave at Round Rock Senior Living have been waiting out the quarantine in boredom.\n\nLuckily, Hollywood A-lister and Texas native Matthew McConaughey offered to help keep them entertained earlier this week.\n\nWATCH: TGIF\u2014Quarantined Dad\u2019s Endearing Video Shows What It\u2019s Like Working From Home With a Toddler\n\nAlthough The Enclave residents have been trying to get McConaughey to visit their nursing home for several months now, the actor respected the rules of social distancing by hosting some rousing games of bingo over a video livestream.\n\nWith his wife and kids watching in delight, McConaughey called out the numbers to the seniors on the conference call until one of the residents got a bingo.

His goal? To circumnavigate the globe non-stop, and without the aid of any electronic navigational devices. He hopes to become the first North American to ever complete this type of journey using only a sextant, almanac, pen, paper, and logbook for navigation.\n\nCoincidentally, Bert already has become, literally, the safest person on the planet, bobbing about at sea on a voyage planned long before the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n\nAt the time of this writing, April 1, Bert was nearing Australia, two-thirds of the way through his journey. Many battles have been waged and won aboard the Seaburban, including violent weather, emergency repairs, extreme temperatures from roasting to freezing, and moldy food.\n\nRELATED: This Epic Pirate Cat Has Spent Her Whole Life Sailing the Ocean (Look)\n\nBorn on the flat prairie of southern Saskatchewan, Bert was raised as far away from any ocean as you can imagine. His Dutch ancestry, however, is rich in sailing tradition, his father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all professional sailors. Jan ter Hart trained his four children in the fine art of sailing during windy summer days on Boundary Dam Lake, a man-made reservoir near Estevan, Saskatchewan, the family\u2019s hometown.\n\nWhile at sea, he has garnered a following of over 2000+ people watching his journey, day by day, including many Canadian schoolchildren all asking, \u201cWhere is Mr. ter Hart now?\u201d\n\nThe journey was to have lasted six months, but delays due to extreme weather, requiring sailing many kilometers off course to avoid hurricanes and extreme winds, has stretched the journey to eight months.\n\nDuring his trip he has been cataloguing information on climate change, which he will pass on to oceanographic scientific research companies\u2014all while maintaining the most rigorous \u201csocial distancing\u201d of anyone on Earth.\n\nLOOK: Rather Than Slip into Depression, Man Quits Job, Sells Possessions, and Travels the World With a Ferret\n\nTo be successful as the first North American to achieve this goal, there can be no stopping to disembark at any port. Nine months worth of food, water and supplies had to be brought on board. Including, yes, toilet paper.\n\nThe only other passenger on this voyage is Mr. Salty, a stuffed seal, who finds himself in all kinds of trouble aboard ship, and continuously demands higher pay for fewer chores.\n\nBert\u2019s goal is not so much to be the first to complete a journey of this kind, which will end in San Francisco, but to inspire young people to take hold of their craziest dreams and fashion them into reality.\n\nWhen asked what advice he would give those of us on land who are dealing with the coronavirus, terHart told GNN, \u201cSelf isolation is an opportunity to learn more about oneself. It is rare that we have the time to really examine what it is that we we want to become, and hope to leave behind as a legacy.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThese are fundamental questions and need good answers. Our normal lives generally preclude the time necessary to really examine them in detail. This, for some, might very well be that time.\u201d\n\nSHARE the Seafaring Journey on Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Great Gift For News Junkies: Our Good News Book at 20% Off, Plus Free Shipping", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/gnn-book-amazon-launch-2018/", "date": "2018-12-16", "transcript": "Buy the GNN paperback book directly from Good News Network if you\u2019re in the U.S.A. \u2014 and you will save $2.00 compared to the Amazon price\u2014plus get FREE shipping!\n\nHere\u2019s a great gift for all the \u2018news junkies\u2019 in your life: Our book \u2026And Now, The Good News, shines a spotlight on the extraordinary and everyday heroes and solutions to make you feel optimistic and hopeful about our world.\n\nOUTSIDE THE USA?

In addition to her school being closed amidst the coronavirus shutdowns, her parents weren\u2019t home to help her with the equations\u2014and her mom has apparently had a history of getting the algebra questions wrong anyway.\n\nAfter Rylee emailed her math teacher Chris Waba for help, he responded with some written instructions on how to do the equations\u2014but he could tell that she was still having trouble with the homework.\n\nSince Waba knew that his student lived just down the street from his house in Madison, he grabbed a whiteboard and marched over to her front door so he could illustrate his points from the outside of the glass.\n\nRELATED: Maryland Teens Go On Grocery Store Runs for Seniors and Vulnerable Neighbors Amid COVID-19 Fears\n\nHe then spent the next ten minutes giving a one-on-one math lesson to Rylee as she took notes from inside her home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a better communicator face-to-face than [on] the telephone and I think students learn better that way,\u201d Waba, who has been a math teacher for 27 years, told CNN. \u201cTeachers all across the nation have been thrown into a situation like this. I think we\u2019re all more comfortable being in front of our classes and that\u2019s where we\u2019d rather be.\u201d\n\nWhen it seemed like Rylee finally grasped the concept, Waba bid her adieu and headed home.

A critical mass of CCS participants uploading information though the app, launched on March 26th could help data-crunching researchers gain insight into how the virus is spreading and identify ways to predict and reduce the number of new infections, according to Gregory Marcus, professor in the Department of Medicine at UCSF and a co-leader of CCS.\n\nBased around a smartphone app, information on the study can be accessed via the Eureka signup website (if prompted, enter the study key: covid) or by texting \u201cCOVID\u201d to 41411.\n\nMarcus said the researchers\u2019 hope is for the new study to \u201cgo viral\u201d\u2014in a good way\u2014with a goal to ultimately enroll more than 1 million individuals around the world.\n\nRELATED: From Italy to Seattle, Reports Find Social Restrictions Are Working to Curb New COVID-19 Cases\n\n\u201cWe are asking each participant to share the link to recruit at least five others,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cWe want to demonstrate that the number of people signing up for this scientific study and contributing their data can increase exponentially, faster than the disease itself.\u201d To illustrate this hoped-for exponential growth, the researchers plan to create and share a data visualization that maps enrollment in CCS in real time, which Marcus hopes will show study participation outpacing the global spread of the virus.\n\nWith widespread social distancing in place, and with quarantine and isolation for some, public health studies can be challenging, Marcus said\u2014but all that\u2019s needed to join CCS is the link and a smartphone to download the mobile phone-based app. Once enrolled, participants will be asked to complete an initial 10- to 15-minute survey about their health and daily habits. Follow-up questions, delivered by push notification or text message on an ongoing basis, are expected to require five to 15 minutes per week.\n\nParticipants will be also given the option of providing nearly continuous geolocation (GPS) data, and soon, additional data from Fitbit or other Bluetooth-enabled biomonitoring devices, including blood pressure, weight, blood oxygen levels, body temperature, exercise and sleep.\n\nCHECK OUT: After the UK Told James Dyson It Needed 10,000 Ventilators, He Invented One in Just 10 Days\u2014And is Donating 5,000\n\nIn the long term, the collective participation of committed individuals in CCS will help identify behaviors, influences and factors that increase or decrease the risk of infection or that affect outcomes after infection, Marcus said. The greater the number of participants, the greater the likelihood of statistically valid findings emerging from the study.\n\nCCS springs from a project called the Health eHeart Study which Marcus launched in 2013 to harness online and mobile advances in order to collect and analyze cardiovascular information from study participants, using not only surveys, but also smartphone apps, portable blood pressure cuffs and electrocardiogram smartphone cases.\n\nThe experience gained through Health eHeart helped the UCSF team compete successfully when the National Institutes of Health sought to establish a national center for mobile health research. The result is Eureka, a mobile-app-focused health research platform that offers personnel and infrastructure, including cloud-based databases that can handle very dense data from millions of participants, to enable researchers to get studies up and running quickly.\n\nMORE: Researchers Have Found a Way to Sterilize and Reuse Face Masks During Pandemic\n\nHaving already hosted 28 studies by various research teams on Eureka, the UCSF researchers decided to launch CCS on the platform. To stretch beyond cardiology-focused research they enlisted UCSF colleagues from a variety of medical and research specialties to contribute ideas about survey questions and study parameters.\n\n\u201cWe are like a company that during wartime switches from making cars to making tanks,\u201d Marcus said.\n\nHealth eHeart already has nearly 250,000 participants, and spans more than 80 countries worldwide. They are accustomed to taking part in research, sharing personal medical information and being pinged with questions, and they all have been asked to be among the first to join the new CCS project, and to invite others.\n\nLOOK: JOANN Stores are Handing Out Free Fabric Supplies at Curbside to Anyone Sewing Face Masks at Home\n\nWith cell phones become essentially ubiquitous only in recent years, it is still early days for mobile health studies, Marcus said, but CCS has the potential to be the largest-ever prospective epidemiological study of infectious disease, perhaps of any disease. In prospective studies information is collected in real time, instead of relying solely on retrospective memory and other information that can be gathered about past events. In general, prospective studies are considered more likely than retrospective studies to correctly identify associations between variables and risks.\n\n\u201cSocial distancing keeps many protected,\u201d Marcus said, \u201cbut joining together to contribute data will help us beat this thing.\u201d\n\nReprinted from the University of California San Francisco\n\nMultiply The Good News By Sharing This With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "El Museo de Historia Natural Revela un Nuevo Pabell\u00f3n de Gemas despu\u00e9s de A\u00f1os de Remodelaci\u00f3n y se ve Incre\u00edble", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nuevo-pabellon-de-gemas-del-museo-natural-de-historia/", "date": "2020-3-29", "transcript": "Welcome!

When we have no relevant experience or expertise, the vulnerability, uncertainty, and fear of these firsts can be overwhelming\u2014but showing up and pushing ourselves past the awkward, learner stage is how we get braver.\n\nNotable Excerpt: \u201cThis pandemic experience is a massive experiment in collective vulnerability. We can be our worst selves when we\u2019re afraid, or our very best, bravest selves. In the context of fear and vulnerability, there is often very little in between because when we are uncertain and afraid our default is self-protection. We don\u2019t have to be scary when we\u2019re scared. Let\u2019s choose awkward, brave, and kind.

Today, investing in coal projects is more expensive\u2014across all world energy markets\u2014than renewables. In as little as 10 years, it will be cheaper to build renewables than to run coal power resources, much less build new ones.\n\nHow much more expensive? Right now, the report estimates that the cost of operating and investing in coal\u2014not in Europe, but in the U.S., India, and China\u2014is about 50% more expensive than renewables. By 2030, that number doubles to 100% assuming market forces remain constant rather than intensify, which they are likely to do.\n\nLOOK: Toronto Garbage Trucks Will Soon Be Powered by Biogas From the Very Food Scraps That They Collect\n\n\u201cThe market is driving the low-carbon energy transition, but governments aren\u2019t listening,\u201d writes Matt Gray, co-head of power and utilities for Carbon Tracker, and co-author of a new global economic report about coal investments entitled \u201cHow to Waste Half a Trillion Dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cRenewables are outcompeting coal around the world and proposed coal investments risk becoming stranded assets which could lock in high-cost coal power for decades.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the number of countries in which it is cheaper in invest and operate renewable energy assets could make someone optimistic about the future since most underdeveloped Asian energy markets, as well as the three biggest coal consumers on earth, would all save money switching to renewables, according to this helpful infographic from the report.\n\nHowever, many of these countries still have nationally-planned coal power projects either in early investment stages, or already in production.\n\nMORE: Construction Begins On First Ever Commercial Plastics-to-Fuel Factory in the US\n\nAs repeatedly demonstrated by the national debt of the US government, a stranded asset is manageable for most nations, but insufferable for a private firm that is unable to borrow more dollars every year than they invest.\n\nIt is an economic term for an asset\u2014like a coal plant\u2014which will cease to generate returns even before the end of its economic life. These carbon-heavy facilities not only have a slow rate of return and open the door for market competition from renewables, they also are becoming more expensive to invest in, build, and operate, than they are to make returns for those investors.\n\nThat is partially why free market economic forces are working where many governments are failing; it costs a lot of money to build electricity-generating resources, and since banks and financial institutions are the largest funders of energy projects, they simply aren\u2019t willing to finance coal power projects, choosing instead to invest in solar and wind resources.\n\nVietnam: a Greenhouse Government\n\nThe government of Vietnam is currently considering backing away from 15 gigawatts of proposed coal power as financial constraints make it a harder to build new plants, which it wants to do in order to increase economic development.\n\nThe proposed projects would allocate 50% of energy production to coal-fired plants, but an end to the deal would see it drop to 37%, with others like hydroelectric and gas remaining stable, and renewable energy swooping in to cheaply meet the demand and fill the gap in supply.\n\nMuch of the nation\u2019s energy projects are funded by investors in other coal-fired East Asian nations like Japan and South Korea, as well as powerhouse lender Singapore. After a recent aligning of principles with EU nations to restrict coal financing, however, many coal projects in Vietnam will be left stagnating with the government\u2019s only options being to either finish the projects with taxpayer money or listen to market forces and move into cleaner energy production.\n\nCHECK OUT: Instead of Burning Coal, New Fuel Emits Zero Harmful Emissions\u2014and It\u2019s Made From Sewage\n\nOn the other hand, private sector giants like Sir Christopher Hohn, who is the billionaire hedge fund manager and co-founder of the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), threatened to sue British banks Barclays, Standard Chartered, and HSBC over the financing of new coal projects.\n\n\u201cCoal is the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions globally and the risks of its continued use in the power sector are not being adequately addressed by regulators and the financial system,\u201d he said in a statement on the CIFF website.\n\nIrresistible Market Forces\n\nA high price of carbon and significant investment in renewable energy has created a very unfriendly market for coal in the EU, while \u201cHow to Waste Half a Trillion Dollars\u201d finds that today, even big coal consumers like China, India, and the U.S. are on the right path and \u201cnot far behind\u201d the EU in terms of renewable energy investments.\n\n\u201cThe report finds that market forces will drive coal power out of existence in deregulated markets, where renewable energy developers will take advantage of the growing price gap,\u201d reads the report summary on Carbon Tracker\u2019s website. Across the world, 6,700 coal plants produce 2,045 gigawatts of energy, and another 1,000 or so accounting for another 500gw are in early stages of production or investment.\n\nAs the cost of investment, production, and operation of coal plants continues to increase as market forces push investors further and further towards renewables, hundreds of billions of dollars in energy markets the world over will become available at a lower cost, and coal could become twice as expensive, and begin to rapidly vanish\u2014even in large coal-consuming countries like China and India, within just 20 years.\n\nCHECK OUT: After Five Years of Drought, Kenyan Region Finally Gets Clean Water Thanks to Solar-Powered Saltwater Plant\n\nA report from Reuters found that coal power generation fell worldwide by 3% in 2019, while wind and solar power contributed 270 more terawatts, or an additional 15%, to grids. The research went on to illustrate how this growth would be needed every year for 15 years in order to meet the Paris Agreement targets. The power generation would have to continue to fall from 3% to 11% to prevent 1.5 degrees celsius of warming\u2014the rough estimate of wiggle room needed to avoid the worst effects of global climate change.\n\nMoney talks\u2014and if coal production will rise from from 50% to 100% in the U.S., India, and 60% to 100% in China, in just ten years, it means that far from unlimited growth targets being met for investors, coal barons will have to cope with a 5% yearly rise in capital requirements, as well as any future blows coal might be forced to absorb such as carbon taxes, coal embargoes, and other brutish legislative measures.\n\nPower Up With Positivity By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "TGIF: Quarantined Dad\u2019s Endearing Video Shows What It\u2019s Like Working From Home With a Toddler", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/quarantined-dads-video-shows-what-its-like-working-from-home/", "date": "2020-4-3", "transcript": "As millions of adult employees around the world start working from home during the COVID-19 shutdowns, this devoted dad took an adorable video of his average social distancing day on the job\u2014and the resulting footage is pretty darn sweet.\n\n(WATCH the video below)\n\nBe Sure And Share The Cute Clip With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "On Her 86th Birthday, Check Out the Jane Goodall Documentary Trailer We Can All Use Right Now: \u2018The Hope\u2019", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/jane-goodall-documentary-trailer-we-can-all-use-right-now/", "date": "2020-4-3", "transcript": "This week, National Geographic released the trailer for a new documentary about the incredible life of scientist and activist Jane Goodall\u2014and it is already shaping up to be a much-needed lesson in global optimism.\n\nThe 2-hour documentary Jane Goodall: The Hope is set to premiere on Nat Geo, Nat Geo WILD and Nat Geo Mundo on Earth Day (April 22nd).\n\nThe invigorating trailer offers a glimpse at how the film will celebrate the 60-year career of the activist and how she is still working tirelessly to promote a message of hope for the earth.\n\nRELATED: Adults Are Describing Their Reactions to the New Mr. Rogers Documentary\u2014And It\u2019s Incredibly Sweet\n\n\u201cAt age 26, Jane Goodall\u2019s discovery that chimpanzees make and use tools shook the foundations of modern science and redefined the relationship between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom,\u201d reads the trailer summary. \u201cIn 1977, she founded the Jane Goodall Institute to inspire hope through action around the world and for generations to come.\n\n\u201cToday, Jane is an author, advocate and public speaker, traveling an average 300 days per year sharing her reasons for hope and message that we can each make a difference to create a better world for all, every single day.\u201d\n\nIf you need any other reason to celebrate the conservationist\u2019s achievements, today (April 3rd) is also her 86th birthday.\n\n(WATCH the heartening trailer below)\n\nPreserve The Positivity By Sharing This With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Ni\u00f1o Ruso Pinta Asombrosos Retratos de Mascotas a Cambio de Donaciones a los Refugios de Animales Locales", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nino-ruso-pinta-para-animales-de-refugio/", "date": "2020-3-27", "transcript": "Welcome!

While there were steep losses in marine biodiversity throughout the 20th century, population losses have slowed and in some places bounced back in the first two decades of the 21st century.\n\nRELATED: For First Time Ever, Scientists Identify How Many Trees to Plant and Where to Plant Them to Stop Climate Crisis\n\nCo-author of the study, Professor Callum Roberts from the Department of Environment and Geography at the University of York, said: \u201cThe success of many marine conservation projects in recent years illustrates how we can make a real difference to life in our oceans if we apply the lessons learnt from them at scale and with urgency.\n\n\u201cOver-fishing and climate change are tightening their grip, but there is hope in the science of restoration. We now have the skills and expertise to be able to restore vital marine habitats such as oyster reefs, mangrove swamps and salt marshes\u2014which keep our seas clean, our coasts protected and provide food to support entire ecosystems.\u201d\n\n\u201cScience gives us reason to be optimistic about the future of our oceans,\u201d Roberts added.\n\nClimate change\n\nThe review states that the recovery rate of marine life can be accelerated to achieve substantial recovery within two to three decades for most components of marine ecosystems, if climate change is tackled and efficient interventions are deployed at large scale.\n\nMORE: One Million \u2018Wonder Plant\u2019 Seedlings Are Planted in Wales to Fight Climate Crisis\u2014and Create Healthy Seas\n\nThe researchers have identified nine components integral to rebuilding marine life, saltmarshes, mangroves, seagrass, coral reefs, kelp, oyster reefs, fisheries, megafauna and the deep-sea.\n\nThe report identifies specific actions within the broad themes of protecting species, harvesting wisely, protecting spaces, restoring habitats, reducing pollution, and the mitigation of climate change.\n\nThe actions recommended include identified opportunities, benefits, possible roadblocks and remedial actions. They provide a tangible road map to deliver a healthy ocean providing huge benefits for people and planet.\n\nCHECK OUT: Whales Feces Represent One of the Greatest Allies Against Climate Change\u2014Even More Than Trees\n\nThe report states that success largely depends upon the support of a committed, resilient global partnership of governments and societies aligned with this goal.

But no significant associations emerged for overall stroke risk and water temperature.\n\nCHECK OUT: These are the 3 Most Promising Longevity Supplements From Scientific Research So Far\n\nAfter excluding those participants who developed cardiovascular disease within 5 or 10 years of the start of the study, the associations found weren\u2019t quite as strong, but nevertheless still remained statistically significant.\n\nThis is an observational study, and as such, can\u2019t establish cause, added to which changes in bathing frequency weren\u2019t tracked during the monitoring period. The typical style of Japanese bathing also includes immersion to shoulder height, and this may be a critical factor.\n\nBut, say the researchers, previously published research has pointed to a link between heat exposure and cardiovascular disease prevention: this is because the effects of heat on the body are not dissimilar to those of exercise.\n\nRELATED: Largest Study of Its Kind Identifies the Surprising Health Benefits of Fasting Every Other Day\n\n\u201cWe found that frequent tub bathing was significantly associated with a lower risk of hypertension, suggesting that a beneficial effect of tub bathing on risk of [cardiovascular disease] may in part be due to a reduced risk of developing hypertension,\u201d write the researchers.\n\nThey acknowledge that taking a hot bath is not without its risk, particularly if the temperature is too high, a point that is taken up by Dr. Andrew Felix Burden in a linked editorial.\n\nReprinted from BMJ\n\nBe Sure And Share This Heart-Handy Research With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "NBA Players Recovered From COVID-19 Are Donating Plasma to Clinical Trials Helping Sick Patients", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nba-players-recovered-from-covid-19-are-donating-plasma-to-help-sick-patients/", "date": "2020-4-2", "transcript": "A number of NBA players who have recovered from COVID-19 are now becoming role models for a new national healthcare initiative to treat patients who are still sick with an experimental therapy.\n\nJust days after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved testing of \u201cconvalescent plasma treatment\u201d, physicians at the Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas became the first in the nation to test the therapy on a small group of COVID-19 patients this week.\n\nThe treatment involves drawing blood plasma out of an individual who has built up an immunity to the virus as a result of their recovery. The plasma\u2014which is chocked full of healthy antibodies that have grown to fight the virus\u2014is then injected into a sick patient so the antibodies can theoretically attack the virus for its new host.\n\nRELATED: After the UK Told James Dyson It Needed 10,000 Ventilators, He Invented One in Just 10 Days\u2014And is Donating 5,000\n\nSince hospitals across the country are now searching for recovered COVID-19 patients to donate blood plasma, several NBA players are now cooperating with the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project (CCPP19) to volunteer as donors.\n\nDr. Michael Joyner, who is a member of the project\u2019s leadership team, told ABC News that four basketball players are participating in the program.

These breakdown the DNA in microbes and stop them from being able to replicate and can arrest the spread of germs, ideally including COVID-19, though they are still awaiting test results for the now-infamous virus to see if the robot can officially be relied upon to remove it.\n\nMany surfaces, especially those on various hospital equipment, need to be washed by hand. Inventor Connor McGinn says his robot would greatly enhance this cleaning process, allowing hospitals that are swamped with patients to clean rooms and equipment without any human being present.\n\n\u201cThis system could reduce dependency on the use of chemical-based solutions, which may be effective but requires rooms to be vacated for several hours during sterilization, making them impractical for many parts of the hospital,\u201d McGinn said on Twitter.\n\nWhile UV rays are damaging to humans, so they cannot be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin, an onboard AI system automatically shuts off Violet\u2019s light if it detects that someone has moved in front of it.\n\nRELATED: FDA Okays Historic Blood Treatment for COVID; Clinical Trials to Use Antibodies From Recovered Patients\n\nThe petite startup of only 7 people, hope to produce 50 units in the coming weeks\u2014with their first robot possibly ready for duty by Easter.\n\nHere's an early demo of our robot, Violet.

When we have no relevant experience or expertise, the vulnerability, uncertainty, and fear of these firsts can be overwhelming\u2014but showing up and pushing ourselves past the awkward, learner stage is how we get braver.\n\nNotable Excerpt: \u201cThis pandemic experience is a massive experiment in collective vulnerability. We can be our worst selves when we\u2019re afraid, or our very best, bravest selves. In the context of fear and vulnerability, there is often very little in between because when we are uncertain and afraid our default is self-protection. We don\u2019t have to be scary when we\u2019re scared. Let\u2019s choose awkward, brave, and kind.

Due to the government-imposed restrictions on public gatherings during the novel coronavirus outbreaks, the race was cancelled.\n\n\u201cIt was going to be my first ever half-marathon and I was excited to do it, so it was devastating when it was cancelled,\u201d said Hustler. \u201cI had put so much training in and it\u2019s such a great cause I am running for, that I still wanted to do it any way I could.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Love in the Time of Corona\u2014NYC Man is Now Dating His Neighbor After He Creatively Woos Her in Quarantine\n\nOrganizers encouraged runners to get creative and identify their own local landmarks and map a run around hidden gems in their area on a solo run.\n\nHowever, Hustler and his girlfriend Chloe Skerritt have been self-isolating since she developed a fever and a cough last week.\n\n\u201cWe have been self-isolating since Monday. We\u2019re fine, but it\u2019s more of a precaution, really,\u201d says Hustler. \u201cWe took the decision to work from home and not go out because my mum works for the NHS and my dad has health issues so we didn\u2019t want to risk spreading anything to vulnerable people.\n\n\u201cI saw a video of a man in Italy who ran a full marathon on his balcony so I thought I could do a half-marathon on mine. I did a little 2-kilometer run on it on Tuesday and I thought \u2018well it\u2019s boring, but I can do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nRELATED: Restaurant Flooded With Business After Launching an \u2018Adopt a Doc or Nurse\u2019 Catering Service\n\nSo with nothing but the views from his third floor apartment in South Woodford, Essex, Hustler completed the run in three hours with Skerritt cheering him on.\n\nHustler, an amateur cricket player Sam who had previously never ran more than 11 miles, said he had been training hard for the half-marathon and did not want that training to go to waste. He also wanted to honor his commitment to raising money for Haven House Children\u2019s Hospice, a charity which supports children with life-threatening or life-limiting illnesses.\n\nCHECK OUT: JOANN Stores are Handing Out Free Fabric Supplies at Curbside to Anyone Sewing Face Masks at Home\n\n\u201cI really wanted to do it for Haven House and raise as much money as possible,\u201d says Hustler. \u201cThey\u2019ve been going since 1990 and they\u2019ve just put up an emergency appeal for funding. All their fundraising events have been cancelled and their charity shops have had to close, which was a major source of their income.\n\n\u201cThey are an amazing charity that believes in the best possible life for every baby and child with a life-limited or life-threatening condition,\u201d he added. \u201cThey do so much for families who live in my community and I\u2019ve seen the work they have done, which is absolutely amazing.\u201d\n\nAlthough Hustler originally planned on running the half-marathon to raise \u00a3500 ($620) for Haven House, his backyard stunt has thus far managed to raise more than \u00a31,900 ($2,400).\n\nRun This Inspiring Story Over To Your Friends By Sharing It To Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Great Gift For News Junkies: Our Good News Book at 20% Off, Plus Free Shipping", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/gnn-book-amazon-launch-2018/", "date": "2018-12-16", "transcript": "Buy the GNN paperback book directly from Good News Network if you\u2019re in the U.S.A. \u2014 and you will save $2.00 compared to the Amazon price\u2014plus get FREE shipping!\n\nHere\u2019s a great gift for all the \u2018news junkies\u2019 in your life: Our book \u2026And Now, The Good News, shines a spotlight on the extraordinary and everyday heroes and solutions to make you feel optimistic and hopeful about our world.\n\nOUTSIDE THE USA?

Given the name hemolithin, the unearthly protein contains iron and lithium.\n\nWhile single and even chains of amino-acids have been found in space before, this is the first time that they have been organized into what could be considered a complete protein.

Studying these water-protein reactions led McGeoch to try to determine whether reactions between the two in interstellar dust clouds could have played a role in the formation of our solar system (see her corresponding paper).\n\nDown here on earth, the same splitting of molecules from water into hydrogen and oxygen would have played a major role in the creation for habitable conditions for life to arise, suggesting that extraterrestrial proteins like hemolithin might have triggered these reactions on earth.\n\nCHECK OUT: Scientists Detect Tone Pattern in the Ringing of a Newborn Black Hole for the First Time, Proving Einstein Right Again\n\nMcGeoch noted that: \u201cIf true, this could be a chemical energy source, which is the most important ingredient for a biochemical process leading on to life.\u201d\n\nMcGeoch is planning to plow forward studying these reactions, acknowledging that the protein, or any protein\u2019s, potential role in the formation of the solar system or otherwise is merely speculation at this point; but for the first time, short of a cell arriving on a meteorite, we have confirmed the off-world presence of at least one major building block to organic life, as well as the possibility of beginning to understand mechanisms that might lead to a planet becoming suitable for it.\n\nBe Sure And Share The Exciting News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026 (Photo by Tom Hall, CC license)", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Ni\u00f1o Ruso Pinta Asombrosos Retratos de Mascotas a Cambio de Donaciones a los Refugios de Animales Locales", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nino-ruso-pinta-para-animales-de-refugio/", "date": "2020-3-27", "transcript": "Welcome!

Most rural populations can\u2019t make money from the incredibly unique forest ecosystem, so the trees are the first to go, when islanders need to make a living.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons the environmental ministry and partners are planting trees that bear fruit and spices which can be harvested for export.\n\nRecent movements turned to education, government protections of land, and the training of rural communities to regard themselves as forest protectors, which have all helped slow the decline of forests and exotic wildlife populations like the 100 species of lemur that are found only on this island.\n\nRELATED: Couple Protects Endangered Madagascar Lemurs By Launching Mobile Library to Teach Indigenous People to Read\n\nBut rigorous reforestation is also needed to support these exotic creatures, so the country is stepping up.

The typical style of Japanese bathing also includes immersion to shoulder height, and this may be a critical factor.\n\nBut, say the researchers, previously published research has pointed to a link between heat exposure and cardiovascular disease prevention: this is because the effects of heat on the body are not dissimilar to those of exercise.\n\nRELATED: Largest Study of Its Kind Identifies the Surprising Health Benefits of Fasting Every Other Day\n\n\u201cWe found that frequent tub bathing was significantly associated with a lower risk of hypertension, suggesting that a beneficial effect of tub bathing on risk of [cardiovascular disease] may in part be due to a reduced risk of developing hypertension,\u201d write the researchers.\n\nThey acknowledge that taking a hot bath is not without its risk, particularly if the temperature is too high, a point that is taken up by Dr. Andrew Felix Burden in a linked editorial.\n\nReprinted from BMJ\n\nBe Sure And Share This Heart-Handy Research With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "First-of-its-Kind Blood Test Can Detect Over 50 Kinds of Cancer\u2014Often Before Symptoms Even Show", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/first-of-its-kind-blood-test-detects-50-kinds-of-cancer-before-symptoms/", "date": "2020-3-31", "transcript": "Researchers have developed the first blood test that can accurately detect more than 50 types of cancer and identify in which tissue the cancer originated, often before there are any clinical signs or symptoms of the disease.\n\nIn a paper published today on March 31st in the leading cancer journal Annals of Oncology, the researchers show that the test\u2014which could eventually be used in national cancer screening programs\u2014has a 0.7% false positive rate for cancer detection, meaning that less than 1% of people would be wrongly identified as having cancer.\n\nAs a comparison, about 10% of women are wrongly identified as having cancer in national breast cancer screening programs, although this rate can be higher or lower depending on the number and frequency of screenings and the type of mammogram performed.\n\nThe test was able to predict the tissue in which the cancer originated in 96% of samples, and it was accurate in 93%.\n\nRELATED: In a Revolutionary Medical Treatment, Man\u2019s Lung Was Removed, Cleaned, and Replaced\u2014No Transplant Necessary\n\nTumors shed DNA into the blood, and this contributes to what is known as cell-free DNA (cfDNA). However, as the cfDNA can come from other types of cells as well, it can be difficult to pinpoint cfDNA that comes from tumors. The blood test reported in this study analyses chemical changes to the DNA called \u201cmethylation\u201d that usually control gene expression. Abnormal methylation patterns and the resulting changes in gene expression can contribute to tumor growth, so these signals in cfDNA have the potential to detect and localize cancer.\n\nThe blood test targets approximately one million of the 30 million methylation sites in the human genome. A machine learning classifier (an algorithm) was used to predict the presence of cancer and the type of cancer based on the patterns of methylation in the cfDNA shed by tumors. The classifier was trained using a methylation database of cancer and non-cancer signals in cfDNA. The database is believed to be the largest in the world and is owned by the California-based company involved in this research, GRAIL, Inc..\n\nSenior author of the paper and President of US Oncology Dr. Michael Seiden said: \u201cOur earlier research showed that the methylation approach outperformed both whole genome and targeted sequencing in the detection of multiple deadly cancer types across all clinical stages, and in identifying the tissue of origin. It also allowed us to identify the most informative regions of the genome, which are now targeted by the refined methylation test that is reported in this paper.\u201d\n\nMORE: Accidental Discovery of New T-Cell Hailed as Major Breakthrough for \u2018Universal\u2019 Cancer Therapy\n\nIn the part of the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (CCGA) study reported today, blood samples from 6,689 participants with previously untreated cancer (2,482 patients) and without cancer (4,207 patients) from North America were divided into a training set and a validation set. Of these, results from 4,316 participants were available for analysis: 3,052 in the training set (1,531 with cancer, 1,521 without cancer) and 1,264 in the validation set (654 with cancer and 610 without cancer). Over 50 types of cancer were included.\n\nThe machine learning classifier analyzed blood samples from the participants to identify methylation changes and to classify the samples as cancer or non-cancer, and to identify the tissue of origin.\n\nThe researchers found that the classifier\u2019s performance was consistent in both the training and validation sets, with a false positive rate of 0.7% in the validation set.\n\nCHECK OUT: FDA Approves Pancreatic Cancer Drug Treatment After It Was Shown to Double Patient Lifespans\n\nThe classifier\u2019s ability to correctly identify when cancer was present (the true positive rate) was also consistent between the two sets. In 12 types of cancer that are often the most deadly (anal, bladder, bowel, esophageal, stomach, head and neck, liver and bile duct, lung, ovarian and pancreatic cancers, lymphoma, and cancers of white blood cells such as multiple myeloma), the true positive rate was 67.3% across clinical stages I, II and III.\n\nThese 12 cancers account for about 63% of cancer deaths each year in the USA and, at present, there is no way of screening for the majority of them before symptoms show. The true positive rate was 43.9% for all cancer types in the study across the three clinical stages.\n\nDetection improved with each cancer stage. In the 12 pre-specified cancers, the true positive rate was 39% in stage I, 69% in stage II, 83% in stage III and 92% in stage IV.

To our knowledge, this is the largest clinical genomics study, in participants with and without cancer, to develop and validate a blood test for early detection of multiple cancers.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Husband-Wife Duo Has Developed \u2018Gene and Cell Therapy\u2019 Cancer Vaccine Now Being Tested on Patients\n\nThe study is funded by GRAIL, the maker of the blood test.

The ongoing studies are assessing the test\u2019s performance in even broader populations. Limitations include: all the participants with cancer had already been diagnosed with cancer (e.g. via screening or patients presenting with symptoms); the study was not designed to establish the test\u2019s impact on death from cancer or other causes; at the time of this analysis, not all patients had been followed for a year, which is needed to ensure their non-cancer status was accurate; and some inaccuracy occurred in the detection of the tissue of origin for cancers that are driven by the human papilloma virus (HPV), such as cancers of the cervix, anus, and head and neck\u2014this information is being used to improve the test\u2019s performance.\n\nEditor-in-chief of Annals of Oncology, Professor Fabrice Andr\u00e9, said: \u201cThis is a landmark study and a first step toward the development of easy-to-perform screening tools. Earlier detection of more than 50% of cancers could save millions of lives every year worldwide and could dramatically reduce morbidity induced by aggressive treatments.\n\n\u201cWhile numbers are still small, the performance of this new technology is particularly intriguing in pancreatic cancer, for which mortality rates are very high because it is usually diagnosed when it\u2019s at an advanced stage.\u201d\n\nReprinted from European Society for Medical Oncology\n\nTreat Your Friends To A Daily Dose Of Good News By Sharing This To Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Disheartened by News Reports, Caf\u00e9 Owner Withdraws $10,000 in Cash to Give Away to Unemployed Strangers", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/australian-cafe-owner-gives-away-10k-in-cash-to-unemployed-strangers/", "date": "2020-3-30", "transcript": "A 62-year-old Australian caf\u00e9 owner has been affectionately nicknamed \u201cGenerous Pete\u201d after he spent his afternoon handing out $100 bills to people left unemployed by the COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nDespite how Pete Darmos had been forced to close his restaurant in Melbourne amidst the outbreaks, he felt inspired to share his financial fortune with his community last week after watching a particularly emotional news segment about the lines of people queuing up outside of social security offices across the city.\n\nRather than twiddle his thumbs at home, Darmos rushed to the bank, withdrew $10,000 in cash, and handed out each of the $100 notes to the people standing in line at the nearby Centrelink location in Box Hill.\n\nRELATED: Restaurant Flooded With Business After Launching an \u2018Adopt a Doc or Nurse\u2019 Catering Service\n\n\u201cI started at the back of the queue and then basically handed everybody a $100 note,\u201d he told 7 News. \u201cThere were tears and disbelief. $100 is not a lot of money, but four or five bags of food meant a lot to these people.\u201d\n\nDarmos later told reporters that although he had initially wanted to keep his identity anonymous, he now hopes that news of his good deed will inspire other people to show some compassion to their neighbors during these turbulent times.\n\nThis is just one of many positive stories and updates that are coming out of the COVID-19 news coverage this week.

Ever since the scientific community began to encourage the planting of trees to \u2018re-wild\u2019 previously lost forest ecosystems to respond to climate change, some very determined members of the human race have rolled up their sleeves and produced remarkable results.\n\nRELATED: Scientists Use Recycled Sewage Water to Grow 500-Acre Forest in the Middle of Egyptian Desert\n\nAs Senegal\u2019s former Minister of Ecology (and later Fisheries), the 67-year-old was able to rally citizens from the local coastal population to help him plant 152 million mangrove buds by hand, and it created a truly beautiful coastal mangrove forest stretching hundreds of square miles\u2014one of the largest of its kind in the world.\n\nA Paradise for Crabs\u2014and Environmental Ministers\n\nRecently, Jean Francois Bastin et al. estimated that 2.4 billion acres of additional forest cover on the earth (1B hectares) would suck 25% of all the carbon currently being pumped into the atmosphere. Science like this was in large part responsible for the World Economic Forum\u2019s launch of the Trillion Trees vision.\n\nBecause they store immense amounts of carbon in their submerged root systems, mangroves and other bodies of coastal vegetation are some of our planet\u2019s most important ecosystems. They help filter river mud runoff from entering the sea, while absorbing the brunt of tidal waves and tsunamis. And they also provide some of the most valuable habitat for near-shore wildlife including birds, insects, invertebrates, crustaceans, reptiles, fish, and even monkeys.\n\nMORE: First Drone Project of Its Kind in Canada is Aiming to Plant 1 Billion Trees by 2028\n\nIn a video interview with BBC, Haidar described how the original mangrove forest in Southern Senegal was disrupted in the 80s and 90s as the nation began to build roads which diverted or ended the flow of rivers. \u201cAt the time there were no environmental impact studies, of course.\u201d\n\nNext came the lumbermen who clear-cut the coastal mangroves. It wasn\u2019t, as Haidar explains, until the salt from the sea water entering the delta poisoned the nearby rice fields that people began to think about replacing what had been lost.\n\nWATCH: Man Succeeds Where Government Fails\u2014He Planted a Forest in the Middle of a Cold Desert\n\nThough nearing his seventh decade of life, Haidar swims butterfly stroke through the water-borne forest of his and his colleagues\u2019 making, pointing out the presence of returning wildlife as a boon to the local economy.\n\n\u201cThe mangrove is a fantastic ecosystem that attracts rain\u2014and it is well known scientifically that this mud captures methane, and that these leaves capture CO2,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cI take a lot of satisfaction from this.

What mysterious antics they get up to when they\u2019re prowling around the great outdoors? And will we ever understand the inner mysteries of the noble cat mind?\n\nIn an effort to answer these ancient questions, which have plagued the minds of cat-fanciers since the time of the Pharaohs, one team of scientists launched an initiative to track the movements of our feline friends and glean some insight into their outdoor lives.\n\nThe Cat Tracker Project is simple in concept: find out where cats go and what they do. Founded by researchers from the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, the team placed GPS collars on the cats of willing volunteers.\n\nAfter tracking the movements and behavior of nearly 1,000 cats across four countries and analyzing the data for six years, the results are in\u2014and some of the findings come as a bit of a shock.\n\nLOOK: This Epic Pirate Cat Has Spent Her Whole Life Sailing the Ocean\n\n\u201cI was surprised at how little these cats moved,\u201d lead project author Roland Kays told National Geographic. \u201cMost of them spent all their time within 100 meters [330 feet] of their yard.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that all cats were layabouts, however. National Geographic\u2019s Jonathan Losos goes on to note: \u201cSeven percent covered more than 25 acres, and several cats had enormous ranges. The record-setter was Penny, a young female from the suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand, who roamed over the hills behind her house, covering an area greater than three square miles.\u201d\n\nThen there was Max, a neutered tomcat from England who walked from his home village of St. Newlyn East all the way to Trevilson\u2014over a mile\u2014and back for no apparent reason. Max made this trek twice in the six days he was tracked, leaving his human as mystified as the researchers.\n\nRELATED: Missing Cat Finally Reunited With Owner After It Was Found Wandering the Streets 1,400 Miles Away\n\nIf you have an outdoor cat, reading some of these anecdotes might confirm something you\u2019ve long suspected: that the inner machinations of a cat\u2019s mind are an unknowable enigma\u2014a felicitous riddle whose answer they themselves might not possess.\n\nOn the other hand, don\u2019t let the tales of adventurous ramblers worry you\u2014the study found that the vast majority of cats are, simply put, \u201cuniversally lazy\u201d, according to Kays. Aloof though their personalities may seem, chances are our furry companions are strolling just outside our own backyards, and not farther.\n\nHowever, the Cat Tracker Project doesn\u2019t end there. If have you ever wanted to understand your cat\u2019s personality, the project\u2019s website explains: \u201cWith help from our colleagues at Discovery Circle in Australia, we know that there are 5 overarching traits in feline personality, aptly named the \u2018Feline Five\u2019. They consist of Skittishness, Outgoingness, Spontaneity, Dominance and Friendliness. The results are calculated on a scale, showing how much your cat exhibits characteristics in each of the Feline Five traits.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: Man Who Loves Cats Transforms Home into Feline Playland\u2014And You Can Too (For Charity)\n\nThe Cat Tracker Project also has a branch of their work that studies how much pet cats hunt local birds and mammals for sport. By analyzing hair and food samples from participants, researchers can learn about whether a particular cat is \u201csnacking beyond the food bowl\u201d. While this might seem merely like an unsavory side-effect of cat ownership, recent research actually indicates that free-ranging domestic cats in the United States alone kill up to 4 billion birds and 22 billion mammals each year. That could be over three times the population of human beings on planet Earth!\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the staggering number of birds killed by pet cats has led an intrepid kitty-owner to take action. In 2018, GNN covered a story about a cat mom named Nancy Brennan who had become increasingly frustrated by how many birds regularly fell prey to her pet cat George\u2014and she became determined to stop him from hunting birds by any means necessary.\n\nUpon reading an article about how birds tend to take notice of bright colors, Brennan created a rainbow kitty collar for George to wear. Its vibrant hues alerted nearby birds to the cat\u2019s presence, and shortly after, she was delighted to find that George had stopped killing birds.\n\nMORE: Frozen Cat That Was Found Unresponsive, Buried in Snow Makes Miraculous Recovery\n\nHer \u201cBirds Be Safe\u201d collar ended up being so anecdotally effective for other pet owners that an ornithologist and professor at St. Lawrence University, S.K. Wilson, decided to run a 12-week scientific study on its success. Wilson\u2019s study proved that cats killed 19 times fewer birds when wearing one of Brennan\u2019s bright collars. The study brought a flood of new traffic to Brennan\u2019s collar-selling site, which now distributes its bird-saving devices to cat parents all across the world\u2014not to mention the stylish flair that the collars give their cats.\n\nYou can read the full story of George and the Birds Be Safe collars by clicking here\u2014otherwise, if you are interested in volunteering your own feline friend to participate in the Cat Tracker Project, be sure and visit their website for more information.\n\n(WATCH the 2014 Nat Geo video on The Cat Tracker Project below) \u2013 Feature Photo by Nat Geo\n\nBe Sure And Share This Pawesome Story With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "New Positive Podcast \u2013 Inspiring Daily COVID Updates from Geri & Anthony!", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/episode-2-podcast-with-some-inspiring-covid-19-updates-from-geri-anthony/", "date": "2020-3-18", "transcript": "Episode #4 of our quarantine-inspired podcast just dropped\u2014and we are doing shows every few days during this COVID-19 craziness, as the perfect antidote to today\u2019s 24-hour cable news.\n\nJoin Geri and Anthony as they talk about the \u2018corona kindness\u2019 breaking out all over the world, the silver linings, pandemic-positives, and the most exciting breakthroughs in technology, business, and health this week.\n\nListen and Subscribe to Episodes on iTunes\u2014or Spotify, here \u2014 or, on Podbean\u2026\n\nOur Good News Gurus are bringing you the most inspiring positive news from the last few days, like a breakthrough company that uses recycled aluminum instead of batteries to store solar energy; and a new treatment for lyme disease (and other good news).\n\nEmail Us: We\u2019d love to share your story, answer questions, or interview you on the show: [email protected]\n\nGo Listen and Subscribe to Episodes on iTunes\u2014or Spotify, here \u2014 or, on Podbean\u2026\n\nGood News Network Founder Geri Weis-Corbley along with GNN co-owner Anthony Samadani will be recording a couple episodes each week to serve their fans with a reassuring and uplifting focus.

When we have no relevant experience or expertise, the vulnerability, uncertainty, and fear of these firsts can be overwhelming\u2014but showing up and pushing ourselves past the awkward, learner stage is how we get braver.\n\nNotable Excerpt: \u201cThis pandemic experience is a massive experiment in collective vulnerability. We can be our worst selves when we\u2019re afraid, or our very best, bravest selves. In the context of fear and vulnerability, there is often very little in between because when we are uncertain and afraid our default is self-protection.

Many times, I have read how people feel good after they help someone through volunteering, or even holding a door open\u2014and I\u2019ve felt it myself.\n\nIf persuaded to explain why it feels good, it is clear that helping someone else (or simply witnessing kindness) sets off a series of changes in the brain similarly to the release of endorphins, the internal opiates. Spiritually, of course, helping someone is the right thing to do. The biological connection between my spiritual understanding and how I feel suggests that nature has wired me to do so; my body is reinforcing/rewarding these \u201cright things\u201d with pleasurable sensations. Similarly, the receiver also feels good because he or she has been acknowledged or valued.\n\nActs of kindness therefore create meaningful connections between people. It is part of what I have called the \u201ckindness-connection cycle\u201d, in which acts of kindness connect the giver and receiver to one another.\n\nThe focus of this class is the last arc of the kindness-connection cycle, which states that meaningful connection increases kindness in turn. The central idea is that when we truly understand how each of our lives is intertwined with so many others, kindness, compassion, and collaboration flow much more naturally.\n\nRELATED: Why We Should Practice Forest Bathing and How to Get the Benefits of \u2018Forest Medicine\u2019\n\nAlthough we are unique individuals, our lives are part of a dynamic and vibrant larger network. What each of us does in that network influences many others and vice versa\u2014i.e., we are in this together.\n\nThere are many different examples of how we are connected to each other, such as being connected through economics, interpersonal interactions, workplace, community, family, etc.\n\nOne overlooked aspect of being connected to each other, however, is the common biology that we share. For example, blood courses through our arteries and veins before being filtered by the kidneys and pumped by a heart which beats approximately 100,000 times every day.\n\nThere are many other systems that, with slight variation, function the same way in healthy people, such as the regulation of blood sugar, blood pressure, and immune responses \u2013 and although we may differ in outward appearance (height, body, facial shape, or skin color), our bodies still generally work the same way.\n\nMORE: Instead of \u2018We Are What We Eat,\u2019 the Science of Kindness Says \u2018We Are What We See\u2019 in Daily Life\n\nBeyond the systems that we have in common, we also actively share our biological lives with each other. Let\u2019s focus on oxygen, one of the most abundant elements on the planet that is absolutely critical for our survival. Inhaled oxygen (O2) is required to use calories and convert them into energy fuel for our cells; this process then produces carbon dioxide (CO2) which we exhale as a byproduct. Life is not possible without oxygen.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that you and I are hiking a trail in the woods and we stop to admire a vista. Much of the oxygen we are inhaling is probably produced by the trees and plant life\u2014yet how did the tree make oxygen? As other hikers have gone through the forest, the trees\u2014powered by sunlight\u2014absorb the carbon dioxide that is exhaled by the hikers so they can transform it into cellulose. O2 is then released from the CO2 that the trees have absorbed, thus continuing the oxygen cycle between the hikers and the trees.\n\nThis means that the oxygen I breathe in to survive was used by someone else in the past to help them live as well\u2014and it will also be used by someone else in the future.\n\nCHECK OUT: Man\u2019s Cancer is Healed After Doing Random Acts of Kindness for a Year\n\nAs oxygen is constantly being recycled, and each person needs about 500 liters of oxygen each day, multiple authors have speculated on how we may have inhaled the same oxygen molecules as Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Jr., or any other historical figure.\n\nThe bottom line: all of our lives depend on sharing, and this sharing extends across time.\n\nThis example also illustrates how we are critically connected to trees and nature. Without plant life, oxygen wouldn\u2019t be produced and carbon dioxide wouldn\u2019t be cleared\u2014and since roughly half of the oxygen on Earth comes from phytoplankton in the oceans, this means that our oxygen-dependent lives are also tied to the sea. Phytoplankton, in turn, depend on waste and motion from larger sea creatures\u2014such as whales.\n\nMORE: It\u2019s Random Acts of Kindness Week \u2013 The Health Benefits of Being Kind and Ideas for Rocking It\n\nWhen something disrupts these cycles, like deforestation or whale hunting, we share in the problems that follow. When we protect and nourish them, however, we honor their significance and are rewarded for it.\n\nWhat goes around, comes around. Life is much more about cycles rather than straight lines. Oxygen is just one of many examples that, by the nature of our shared biology, we are connected to one another. The same is true for nitrogen, water, iron, and a host of other biologically essential factors that are recycled by other life forms. This gets more complex once we include the interactions of insects and animals that are necessary to keep the fabric of our interwoven network healthy and vibrant.\n\nSo what does this teach us? It tells us that our lives are more intimately connected than we might ever have thought. On a basic level, it teaches that sharing (kindness and cooperation) is actively required for living beings to survive.\n\nRELATED: How to Follow Negative News Without Getting Depressed\n\nBeyond that, we are deeply connected by the oxygen cycle in a reciprocating, cooperative way. Without trees and greenery, we would not survive\u2014and as those systems depend on carbon dioxide to survive, we sustain them in turn. Short-sighted selfishness that overuses or abuses a component of the cycle will come back around to affect us.\n\nBut the cycle is fragile; without us doing the right thing to responsibly maintain our part of a mutually nourishing cycle, it can fail. Doing the right thing honors two principles: being kind to and respecting the roles of other members of the cycle, and being kind to ourselves to sustain our own well being.\n\nThe eminent conservationist John Muir wrote: \u201cWhen one tugs at a single thing in nature, you find it attached to the rest of the world.\u201d That is, we are all connected.\n\nInterested in learning more about the science of kindness and its role in your life?

Not only has the treaty spurred healing of the ozone layer, it\u2019s also driving recent changes in Southern Hemisphere air circulation patterns,\u201d said lead author Antara Banerjee, a CIRES Visiting Fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder who works in the Chemical Sciences Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nThe ozone hole, discovered in 1985, has been forming every spring in the atmosphere high over Antarctica. Ozone depletion cools the air, strengthening the winds of the polar vortex and affecting winds all the way down to the lowest layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Ultimately, ozone depletion has shifted the midlatitude jet stream and the dry regions at the edge of the tropics toward the South Pole.\n\nLOOK: \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 New Photos of the Sun\u2019s Surface Are Being Hailed as Landmark Achievement for Science\n\nPrevious studies have linked these circulation trends to weather changes in the Southern Hemisphere, especially rainfall over South America, East Africa, and Australia, and to changes in ocean currents and salinity.\n\nThe Montreal Protocol of 1987 phased out production of ozone-destroying substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Beginning around 2000, concentrations of those chemicals in the stratosphere started to decline and the ozone hole began to recover. In this study, Banerjee and her co-authors have shown that around the year 2000, the circulation of the Southern Hemisphere also stopped expanding polewards\u2014a pause or slight reversal of the earlier trends.\n\n\u201cThe challenge in this study was proving our hypothesis that ozone recovery is in fact driving these atmospheric circulation changes and it isn\u2019t just a coincidence,\u201d Banerjee said.\n\nTo do that, the researchers used a two-step statistical technique called detection and attribution: detecting whether certain patterns of observed wind changes are unlikely to be due to natural variability alone and, if so, whether the changes can be attributed to human-caused factors, such as emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals and CO2.\n\nRELATED: Scientists Detect Tone Pattern in the Ringing of a Newborn Black Hole for the First Time, Proving Einstein Right Again\n\nUsing computer simulations, the researchers first determined that the observed pause in circulation trends couldn\u2019t be explained by natural shifts in winds alone. Next, they isolated the effects of ozone and greenhouse gases separately.\n\nThey showed that while rising CO2 emissions have continued expanding the near-surface circulation (including the jet stream) polewards, only the ozone changes could explain the pause in circulation trends. Prior to 2000, both ozone depletion and rising CO2 levels pushed the near-surface circulation poleward. Since 2000, CO2 has continued to push this circulation poleward, balancing the opposing effect of the ozone recovery.\n\n\u201cIdentifying the ozone-driven pause in circulation trends in real-world observations confirms, for the first time, what the scientific ozone community has long predicted from theory,\u201d said John Fyfe, a scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada and one of the paper\u2019s co-authors.\n\nMORE: NASA Happily Reports the Earth is Greener, With More Trees Than 20 Years Ago\u2013and It\u2019s Thanks to China, India\n\nWith ozone recovering and CO2 levels continuing to climb, the future is less certain, including for those Southern Hemisphere regions whose weather is affected by the jet stream and those at the edge of the dry regions.\n\n\u201cWe term this a \u2018pause\u2019 because the poleward circulation trends might resume, stay flat, or reverse,\u201d Banerjee said. \u201cIt\u2019s the tug of war between the opposing effects of ozone recovery and rising greenhouse gases that will determine future trends.\u201d\n\nHowever, a 2018 report from the United Nations says that the infamous hole in the ozone layer could be totally healed by the 2060s\u2014and in some areas of the world, it could be as soon as 2030.\n\nReprinted from the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences\n\nPower Up With Positivity By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch the Heartwarming Moment Residents of Senior Home Sing \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 to Relatives From the Window", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/watch-senior-home-residents-sing-que-sera-sera-to-relatives/", "date": "2020-3-26", "transcript": "This is the heartwarming moment that a group of English care home residents broke into song to entertain their visiting relatives who were listening from the other side of the facility\u2019s glass windows.\n\nThe footage from the Elizabeth House in Benfleet, Essex shows a dozen seniors with dementia singing \u201cQue Sera Sera\u201d as they wave bouquets of daffodils to their family members\u2014all while maintaining a safe social distance from opposite sides of the care home\u2019s window.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a lovely thing to see,\u201d said 52-year-old staff member Gill Petters. \u201cWe usually have singers in, but that is all on hold now what with the coronavirus.\n\nRELATED: Pop Star Grieving His Own Loss Helps 83-Year-Old Widower Check Off Bucket List After Wife\u2019s Death\n\n\u201cWe had to think of different ways to engage and entertain the residents so we set up a choir last week.

The earlier studies did not include fit testing after cleaning\u2014basically sizing the masks for individual wearers\u2014to prove efficacy in the real world, which Duke has now done.\n\nThe decontamination process requires specialized equipment that aerosolizes the hydrogen peroxide, and a closed facility where the masks can be exposed to the vapor.

We can be our worst selves when we\u2019re afraid, or our very best, bravest selves. In the context of fear and vulnerability, there is often very little in between because when we are uncertain and afraid our default is self-protection.

The elastic and foam strips used to secure the mask comfortably to the wearer\u2019s face can be bought at a variety of stores.\n\nSince the dynamic duo\u2019s project has been featured across on national news outlets, they have recruited the help of local teachers to produce the masks in classrooms across the school district. Budmen Industries has also published the templates and assembly instructions for the masks for free on their website.\n\nRELATED: Another Roundup of Positive Updates on the COVID Outbreaks From Around the World\n\nAs more and more healthcare teams have reached out to the couple about getting face masks of their own, hundreds of volunteers from around the world have offered to join the company in 3D-printing the masks for free. According to CNN, the mask design has already been downloaded from their website more than 2,000 times.\n\nSimilarly in Montana, Billings Clinic neurosurgeon Dusty Richardson developed a design for a reusable 3D-printed surgical mask so that he and his fellow community members could donate the masks to their local healthcare workers. He has also made the blueprints and assembly instructions available online for free so his fellow 3D-printing enthusiasts can make their own.\n\nThis is just one of many positive stories and updates that are coming out of the COVID-19 news coverage this week.

In North Carolina, a textile mill is gearing up to start making 10 million masks per week. A number of international fashion companies have also redirected their manufacturing teams to produce face masks as well.\n\nMultiple businesses and schools have donated their recently rediscovered face mask treasure troves to hospitals in need. Other major tech companies such as Facebook and Apple are donating millions of masks and medical supplies to US healthcare facilities. Chinese companies are passing on their own stashes of face masks to European countries newly impacted by the virus. Taiwan is reportedly donating 100,000 masks to the United States.\n\nEven medical TV shows have donated their medical supply props to North American hospitals in need.\n\n3) As American Cities Close Up Amidst Outbreaks, Pollution Plummets\n\nThe United States is now benefiting from the same environmental silver lining to the pandemics as China and Italy: as cities encourage self-isolation, air pollution is plummeting.\n\nOver the course of the last few weeks, satellite imaging has revealed significant reductions in air pollution\u2014particularly across California, Seattle, and New York City.\n\nAccording to CNN, environmental scientists are estimating that the improvement in air quality could collectively save as many as 75,000 people from dying prematurely.\n\n4) As Physicians Worry About Potential Ventilator Shortages, Researchers Develop Several Low-Cost Solutions\n\nIn a stroke of genius, one scientist from the University of Minnesota says he went \u201cfull-on MacGyver\u201d to build a makeshift ventilator in a matter of hours. Although his team has revised his design over the course of several prototypes with the hopes of eventually submitting it for FDA approval, he says that the inexpensive ventilator is one that he \u201cwould be comfortable with someone [using to] take care of me in an ICU or in an operating room.\u201d\n\nThe compassionate medical research continues in Italy as a pair of engineers have taken it upon themselves to 3D-print free respirator parts for their local hospitals. As of last week, the Isinnova startup engineers told Forbes that they had successfully printed more than 100 parts.\n\nMeanwhile, MIT scientists are publishing open-source instructions and research on how to build inexpensive ventilators.\n\n\u201cWe are releasing this material with the intent to provide those with the ability to make or manufacture ventilators, the tools needed to do so in a manner that seeks to ensure patient safety,\u201d they wrote. \u201cClinicians viewing this site can provide input and expertise and report on their efforts to help their patients.\u201d\n\n5) Communities and Countries Opening Up New Lanes of Free Entertainment for the Masses\n\nIn addition to Italians singing songs and playing music together from their balconies, homeowners have begun projecting classic films onto building fronts for the neighbors to enjoy.\n\nAs a means of keeping self-isolated people amused during global shutdowns, many online services have made their services free to the public as well.\n\nFor starters, Amazon has unlocked more than 40 new children\u2019s shows for all of their customers to watch for free, regardless of Prime membership. Audiobook platform Audible has also released a number of free audiobooks for users to stream from their devices.\n\n\u201cFor as long as schools are closed, we\u2019re open. Starting today, kids everywhere can instantly stream an incredible collection of stories, including titles across six different languages, that will help them continue dreaming, learning, and just being kids,\u201d reads the Audible website. \u201cAll stories are free to stream on your desktop, laptop, phone or tablet. Explore the collection, select a title and start listening. It\u2019s that easy.\u201d\n\nMore than 2,500 art museums and galleries have also partnered with Google to offer free virtual tours and displays of their collections to art lovers around the world.\n\nIf you prefer cuter online content, then you can check out this handy list of zoos and aquariums offering livestreams of their animal residents.\n\n6) More Than 100,000 People Have Already Recovered From the Virus Worldwide\n\nAccording to research from Johns Hopkins University, more than 100,000 COVID-19 patients have already made full recoveries from the infection\u2014and that number may very well climb ever higher as more and more potential treatments are tested around the world.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough, patients as old as 90 have managed to recover from the virus as well.\n\nAs Chinese cities gradually reopen to the public now that they have gotten the virus under control with less than 10 new infections reported each day, other countries are expected to experience similar recoveries during the coming months.\n\n7) Nobel Prize Winner Who Correctly Predicted COVID-19 Trends Says \u2018We\u2019re Going To Be Fine\u2019\n\nAccording to a recently-published interview with the Los Angeles Times, Nobel laureate and Stanford biophysicist Michael Levitt has been \u201cremarkably accurate\u201d in predicting China\u2019s recovery from the virus since he began researching the infection rates back in January.\n\nLevitt, who won the 2013 prize for developing complex chemical models of calculation, says that as long as countries continue to practice safe self-isolation measures, the numbers show that they are already beginning to experience slow signs of improvement.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is to control the panic,\u201d he told the news outlet. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d\n\n8) Celebrities and Businesses Have Contributed Millions Towards Feeding and Caring for At-Risk People\n\nFrom Michelin-starred Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s to the Bill Gates Foundation\u2014millions of dollars are being donated to novel coronavirus research and charities feeding families amidst the shutdowns.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to quantify just how many resources are being contributed to the cause, but suffice it to say that it\u2019s a lot\u2014in fact, here\u2019s just a quick list of celebrities giving back to their communities that we published last week.\n\nOakland is closing schools bc of COVID-19.

Once we removed all the casino equipment and furniture from the casino area, that became another large vacant space, and then with any business we had an entire administrative area with cubicles and offices that became perfect for their offices to move in.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Finally, a Native Californian Tribe Has Land To Call Their Own\n\nAlong with Hollywood\u2019s enduring love of western films, Camel Rock and the Tesque Pueblo Nation are looking to take advantage of a filming boom in New Mexico, with recent successes behind shows like Breaking Bad luring more projects to the area.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t realize it but this area looks like a lot of places in the world\u2026especially the Middle-East, with the mountains and how rugged it is,\u201d Brown added, explaining the Tribe\u2019s thinking.\n\nNetflix even made Albuquerque its U.S. production hub, purchasing Albuquerque Studios as part of a plan to spend $100 million in filming and production for original material in the state over the next 10 years.\n\nMORE: One of Largest Native American Tribes Just Voted to End Their 100-Year Dependency on Coal\n\nPueblo of Tesuque Governor Robert Mora, Sr. said that he hopes the economic benefit from the studio will go toward much-needed healthcare projects for the Tribe, such as a universal coverage option.\n\n\u201cThe other thing I\u2019m hoping is that one of the big film companies will find a good home here so they\u2019re not searching for locations.

The bill moves to transition Virginia\u2019s energy economy to 100% renewables by 2050\u2014one of Governor Ralph Northam\u2019s campaign pledges.\n\nThe two affected power companies, Dominion Energy and American Electric Power, have until 2045 to retire electric generation powered by fuels that emit carbon dioxide as a byproduct.\n\nCompanies that fail to meet these 100% renewable timelines will have to pay a deficiency tax or purchase carbon offset certificates.\n\nRELATED: Scientists Develop Exciting New Way to Produce Hydrogen Fuel That\u2019s Safe, Cheap, and Ultra-Efficient\n\nTo try and safeguard workers from being laid off due to these deficiency costs, or to provide opportunities for workers who do lose their jobs, the VCEA would take some of the deficiency payments and deposit them into a fund that would finance new training programs for a renewable energy workforce for the modern grid.\n\n\u201cBeginning in 2026 and every three years thereafter, the Commission is required to adjust the required energy efficiency goals for the successive three years,\u201d reads the legislation. Efficiency is part of the VCEA plan to reduce power costs for middle and low-income houses in the state, which legislators hope will amount to $3,500 dollars in savings over 30 years.\n\nFurthermore, monthly rate caps of 6% for power will be placed on low-income earners and families as part of the Percentage of Income Payment Program that will help ensure the grid transition doesn\u2019t burn the pockets of Virginia\u2019s most financially vulnerable.\n\nLOOK: Toronto Garbage Trucks Will Soon Be Powered by Biogas From the Very Food Scraps That They Collect\n\nThe VCEA wants to expand consumer ownership and decentralization of the grid by encouraging more rooftop PV solar panels. This will help speed the transition to 100% renewable by reducing grid demands and increasing grid robustness.\n\nThe reason rooftop solar can contribute to these goals is by allowing homeowners to generate some of the power they need, while sending the rest into the grid. Each time a new house is powered by solar panels, more renewable energy is available to everyone else in the grid, representing something similar to the Social Security welfare system, but for electricity.\n\nCHECK OUT: California Governor Attacks Crisis of Homelessness by Donating Nearly 300 State-Owned Buildings For Shelters\n\nThis has the added benefit of increasing grid durability, since there will be many-fold more generators of power for plants to draw from decreasing the chance that things like natural disasters\u2014the 2011 Virginia earthquake, for example\u2014will topple the grid and knock out power for everyone.\n\nAccording to Lake Research Partners, 73% of Virginians want state lawmakers to move towards advanced energy investments outlined within the VCEA, and it makes good economic sense for the average family in one of the union\u2019s wealthiest states.\n\nPower Up With Positivity By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch Resourceful Man Use Flying Drone to Walk His Dog During COVID-19 Lockdowns", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/man-uses-flying-drone-to-walk-his-dog-during-lockdowns/", "date": "2020-3-23", "transcript": "A particularly resourceful dog owner in Cyprus has come up with an ingenious way of walking his pup while still staying inside during the COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nVakis Demetriou posted a video to Facebook last week depicting his happy canine companion taking a stroll through the streets of Limassol with his leash carried by a flying drone.\n\nSince Demetriou uploaded the video to social media last week, it has been viewed more than a million times.\n\nThe devoted dog dad hopes that his video will help to lift the spirits of internet users during the turbulence of the pandemic\u2014and remind people to stay home until the virus is under control.\n\n\u201cStay home safe,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut don\u2019t forget your dog\u2019s happiness\u2026\u201d\n\n(WATCH the video below)\n\nBe Sure And Share This Pawesome Story Of Ingenuity With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "From Terrifying to Terrific: Man Redesigns MRI Machine to Delight Children Instead of Scare Them", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/terrifying-terrific-man-redesigns-medical-machine-delight-children-instead-scare/", "date": "2020-3-20", "transcript": "Hospitals can be scary places for children to endure even without leaving the hallways\u2014those MRI scanners, however, could make it into a real nightmare.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging tests and CT scans require children to lie still on a metal bed for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, and the machines usually make loud noises that frighten young patients. Anywhere from 80 to 95% of patients under the age of nine require sedation in order to undergo the ordeal.\n\nFor industrial designer Doug Dietz, witnessing the trauma of the young patients was more than he could bear.

In one of the Adventure Series, children are asked to lie down inside of a canoe.\n\nWATCH: Entire Football Stadium Wave to Sick Kids in Children\u2019s Hospital Next Door\n\n\u201cThey tell children to hold still so that they don\u2019t rock the boat, and if you really do hold still, the fish will start jumping over the top of you,\u201d Dietz explains.\n\nThe Coral City Adventure in the emergency room gives children an underwater experience. It has a disco ball that makes light-like bubbles around the room; children get into a yellow submarine and listen to the sound of harps whilst the procedure takes place. The Cozy Camp adventure gives children the chance to be scanned in a specialized sleeping bag, under a starry sky in an impressive camp setting.\n\nDietz says that the satisfaction that he gets from the children\u2019s reactions made all of his hard work worth it.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like one of your main customers telling you this is a great idea,\u201d Dietz said in a TED talk. \u201cThat probably was the biggest reward I could ever have.\u201d\n\n(This article was originally published by GNN.org in November, 2017.)\n\n(WATCH the video below)\n\nClick To Share The News With Your Friends \u2014 Photo by University of Pittsburgh Hospital", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "As Weather Gets Warmer, Here Are 6 Tips to Save Water on Your Lawn and Gardens", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/6-tips-to-save-water-on-your-lawn-and-gardens/", "date": "2020-3-21", "transcript": "It\u2019s perhaps a bizarre and somewhat arrogant habit we humans have developed; surrounding our houses with a plant species that isn\u2019t native, doesn\u2019t produce food, and usually requires expensive and sometimes unsustainable amounts of water to keep alive.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about lawns, of course; and because 2019 was one of the hottest summers on record, here are some useful tips to getting the most out of your lawn while saving yourself the most money on water and minimizing your impact on local water resources.\n\nWherever you are in the world, there are plants that have adapted to grow and thrive in the soil and climate you reside in.\n\n1) Plant native grasses or grasses that live in conditions of drought.\n\nFor instance, I grew up in zone 7 (find your U.S. zone) in the U.S. mid-Atlantic states, and our back yard (in full sun) was planted with zoysia grass. It tolerates drought and foot traffic from kids and volleyball games, without needing large amounts of fertilizer or much watering at all. It is thick and luscious, and it turns the color of straw in the winter.\n\nTherefore, if you want to save water and still keep your lawn healthy, select a species of grass native to your region, as they will be most resilient to changes in temperature and moisture.\n\nRELATED: Want to Help Bees? Leave the Dandelions Alone This Spring\n\nAlternatively, you can try planting grass species that evolved in regions that receive very little water. In Arizona, residents of Phoenix who prefer a green lawn use midiron grass or Bermuda grass species. The Arizona capital regularly sees temperatures in triple digits, and gets a measly 8 inches of rain a year so drought tolerant grasses help residents save water. Kentucky blue grass is another variety that\u2019s good\u2014especially for seasonal climates that also occasionally suffer droughts.\n\n2) Take advantage of the most biologically-diverse organisms in the US\u2014flowering plants.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to create a healthy garden that you don\u2019t have to water often, the U.S. has 18,000 species of native plants, 16,500 of which will flower during the year. Take advantage of this natural diversity and specialization and find which flowers are native to your area with a simple Google search.\n\nFlowering plants have evolved to deal with the challenges of the climate they live in, so not only will they be more resistant to local weather patterns, but more favorable to local species of bees and other pollinators!\n\n3) If you already have foreign plant species in your yard that need water, plant some trees!\n\nIn USDA-backed research looking at the limits of utilizing trees for energy efficiencies, researchers found that one large mature tree shading a house can have a \u201cnet cooling effect of 10 room-sized air conditioners operating 20 hours a day,\u201d and can save 20 to 50% of the energy used to cool your home. Furthermore, in winter the effect is much the same\u2014by dispersing chilly winds with its branches, large sheltering trees can help reduce your heating costs.\n\nCHECK OUT: After His Brother Gave Up Gardening, Man Designs Tabletop Gardens for People in Wheelchairs\n\nIf these shade tree benefits can be achieved on a home, why not also a garden? If the species you are growing in a pot or in your lawn do well in partial sunlight, consider shading them with a tree, the lack of evaporation from the sun\u2019s heat or from blustery winds will reduce the amount of water they lose.\n\n4) Get smart with your watering habits.\n\nSaving money and local water resources can be as easy as getting a little smarter with your lawn watering habits. For starters, avoid watering your lawn from 12 noon to 6 pm\u2014the hottest time of the day. Instead, get up around 6 to 8AM, or do so at night. This will prevent the water you use from drying out in the sun and wind.\n\nLOOK: No Green Thumb? This Adorable Planter Can Display Your Houseplant\u2019s Needs and Feelings on a Screen\n\nOther than that, adjust your sprinkler head so it doesn\u2019t hit the sidewalk, and mow your lawn often. Grass that\u2019s allowed to grow too tall begins to focus its energy elsewhere, resulting in stunted growth and room for weeds to grow. Finally, be careful not to over-water your lawn, as most only need 1 inch per week, spread over a 2-3 days.\n\n5) Collect the water that nature gives you.\n\nRather than always using the water that comes from the pipes, water that falls from the sky costs nothing and doesn\u2019t deplete any local aquifers. In an area where it does rain sparingly, purchase a rain barrel to collect rain that\u2019s not falling on your lawn or garden to water them with later.\n\nMany cities and counties will pay you to buy a rain barrel or simply distribute one for you if you ask. Check your local regulations and see if they have a rain barrel program. If they offer you a rebate or tax credit for purchasing one go out and buy a pressurized rain barrel system with a cistern or other cool features\u2014it\u2019s on the state\u2019s dime anyway.\n\n6) Install a drip irrigation system.\n\nThis kind of delivery mechanism for your lawn irrigates the roots of the grass directly, rather than relying on the water to come down through the earth. Less water therefore is needed to nourish your lawn because less is wasted from evaporation. While you could hire a contractor to install a drip irrigation system, it makes for an interesting DIY project over a weekend.\n\nPlant These Helpful Hints on Your Friends With Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Ideas Geniales para Hacer en Casa Durante la Cuarentena: Manteng\u00e1monos Positivos", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/que-hacer-en-cuarentena/", "date": "2020-3-29", "transcript": "Welcome!

The typical style of Japanese bathing also includes immersion to shoulder height, and this may be a critical factor.\n\nBut, say the researchers, previously published research has pointed to a link between heat exposure and cardiovascular disease prevention: this is because the effects of heat on the body are not dissimilar to those of exercise.\n\nRELATED: Largest Study of Its Kind Identifies the Surprising Health Benefits of Fasting Every Other Day\n\n\u201cWe found that frequent tub bathing was significantly associated with a lower risk of hypertension, suggesting that a beneficial effect of tub bathing on risk of [cardiovascular disease] may in part be due to a reduced risk of developing hypertension,\u201d write the researchers.\n\nThey acknowledge that taking a hot bath is not without its risk, particularly if the temperature is too high, a point that is taken up by Dr. Andrew Felix Burden in a linked editorial.\n\nReprinted from BMJ\n\nBe Sure And Share This Heart-Handy Research With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch These Self-Isolating Seniors Stave Off Boredom by Playing Life-Sized \u2018Hungry, Hungry Hippos\u2019", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/watch-seniors-play-real-life-hungry-hungry-hippos/", "date": "2020-3-24", "transcript": "As a means of staving off self-isolation boredom, these delighted seniors and their nursing home caretakers played a game of real-life Hungry, Hungry Hippos.\n\nIn a video that was published by the Bryn Celyn Care Home in Maesteg, Wales last week, four elderly women in wheelchairs were filmed giggling away as they were rolled around a room similarly to the classic children\u2019s game.\n\nLOOK: Two-Legged Dog Named \u2018Lieutenant Dan\u2019 is Vying to Be the Next Cadbury Bunny\n\nInstead of using hippo mouths to capture the plastic balls, however, the women brandished baskets on sticks\u2014and the results are pretty amusing.\n\n\u201cResidents really enjoyed playing a new game today: Hungry Hippos.

In Seattle, health care professionals are setting up drive-through test sites that allow patients to submit samples in as little as 3 minutes\u2014all without having to leave their vehicle. Meanwhile, a small town in northern Italy has reported zero new infections since they blanket tested all 3,300 of the town\u2019s residents.\n\nNow, researchers at Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology and Rambam Health Care Campus have tested a method that will dramatically increase the current COVID-19 testing capacity using existing available resources. This method, known as pooling, enables simultaneous testing of dozens of samples.\n\nIts implementation has the potential to greatly accelerate the rate of testing and detection of COVID-19 infected patients in the population. The trial was completed in a matter of days thanks to the support of the Ministry of Health and the close collaboration between Technion and Rambam.\n\nRELATED: 10 Positive Updates on the COVID-19 Outbreaks From Around the World\n\nTesting for COVID-19 is currently being conducted in Israel with the focus on people with specific symptoms. The current rate of testing\u2014about 1,200 a day\u2014does not allow for monitoring of asymptomatic carriers in the population, which is vital to curb the epidemic.\n\nCOVID-19 is diagnosed with PCR testing, which is common for virus monitoring. This test examines the presence of a unique genetic sequence of viruses in a sample taken from the patient. The test takes several hours thus generating a bottleneck in identifying COVID-19 infected people in Israel and around the world.\n\n\u201cToday, we receive approximately 200 COVID-19 test samples a day, and each sample undergoes individual examination,\u201d said Dr. Yuval Gefen, director of the Rambam Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. \u201cAccording to the new pooling approach we have currently tested, molecular testing can be performed on a \u2018combined sample,\u2019 taken from 32 or 64 patients. This way we can significantly accelerate the testing rate. Only in those rare cases, where the joint sample is found to be positive, will we conduct an individual test for each of the specific samples.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: Gates Foundation Commits $100 Million to Speeding Up Coronavirus Treatments and Response\n\nAccording to Professor Roy Kishony, head of the research group in the Faculty of Biology\n\nat Technion, \u201cThis is not a scientific breakthrough, but a demonstration of the effectivity of using the existing method and even the existing equipment to significantly increase the volume of samples tested per day. This is done by pooling multiple samples in a single test tube. Even when we conducted a joint examination of 64 samples in which only one was a positive carrier, the system identified that there was a positive sample.\n\n\u201cAlthough there are some logistical challenges in implementing the method, we expect that it will greatly increase the volume of samples tested per day so that we can identify the asymptomatic carriers. This approach should reduce the chance of infection and flatten the infection curve.\u201d\n\nDirector of the Rambam Virology Lab, Dr. Moran Szwarcwort-Cohen estimates that, \u201cimplementing pooling in the final stage of the PCR test will make it easier for us to shorten the entire process and significantly increase the test rate.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: CDC Director Commits to Free Coronavirus Testing for Anyone in the US Regardless of Insurance\n\nThe American Technion Society supports visionary education and world-changing impact through the Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology. Based in New York City, the institution represent thousands of US donors, alumni, and stakeholders who invest in the Technion\u2019s growth and innovation to advance critical research and technologies that serve the global good. Now with a presence in three countries, the Technion will prepare the next generation of global innovators.\n\nPresident of the Technion Professor Uri Sivan said: \u201cThis experiment conducted by Technion and Rambam researchers is complex, and under normal circumstances would take months. This is a remarkable example of the mobilization of an outstanding team in a time of crisis. The initial experiment was completed in less than four days. This achievement emphasizes the importance of the close relationship between Technion and Rambam and between medicine and engineering. Technion researchers have been enlisted in the war against the coronavirus and this is one of the many activities currently underway at Technion to combat the spread of the disease.\u201d\n\nMultiply The Good By Sharing The News With Your Friends On Social Media \u2013 Representative photo by U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Stephanie Sauberan", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Tyler Perry Picks Up the Tab for All Groceries Purchased During Senior Shopping Hour at 73 Supermarkets", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/tyler-perry-pays-for-senior-groceries-at-73-supermarkets/", "date": "2020-4-9", "transcript": "It\u2019s not uncommon for movie mogul Tyler Perry to make national headlines for his good deeds\u2014and this week, he is being praised by social media users around the world after he was revealed to be an anonymous benefactor for senior shoppers.\n\nAs thousands of elderly citizens browsed the aisles of supermarkets in New Orleans and Atlanta, Georgia, they were stunned to hear that their groceries had been paid for by the \u201cAtlanta Angel\u201d.\n\nThe unidentified do-gooder had picked up the tab for every shopper participating in the senior shopping hour at 44 Kroger locations and 29 Winn-Dixies.\n\nAlthough the donor\u2019s identity had initially been kept a secret, supermarket management later confirmed that it was Tyler Perry.\n\nRELATED: Secret Santa Pays Off $430,000 of Layaway Items at Walmart \u2013 Turns Out it Was Tyler Perry\n\n\u201cSenior and higher-risk Kroger shoppers in metro Atlanta did receive a nice surprise at the register this morning when they learned Tyler Perry had paid their grocery tab in full,\u201d said Felix Turner, the Atlanta spokesman for Kroger.\n\n\u201cWe would like to join our customers in thanking Mr. Perry for his kindness and generosity during this unprecedented pandemic,\u201d Turner continued. \u201cIt was truly a pleasure to see our customers fill with joy and gratitude as the news spread throughout 44 stores across metro Atlanta.\u201d\n\nThis is just one of many positive stories and updates that are coming out of the COVID-19 news coverage this week.

But for up to 20% of people with the tick-borne illness, the antibiotics don\u2019t work, and lingering symptoms of muscle pain, fatigue and cognitive impairment can continue for years\u2014sometimes indefinitely.\n\nA new Stanford Medicine study in lab dishes and mice provides evidence that the drug azlocillin completely kills off the disease-causing bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi at the onset of the illness. The study suggests it could also be effective for treating patients infected with drug-tolerant bacteria that may cause lingering symptoms.\n\n\u201cThis compound is just amazing,\u201d said Dr. Jayakumar Rajadas, assistant professor of medicine and director of the Biomaterials and Advanced Drug Delivery Laboratory at the Stanford School of Medicine. \u201cIt clears the infection without a lot of side effects. We are hoping to repurpose it as an oral treatment for Lyme disease.\u201d\n\nRajadas is the senior author of the study, which was published online earlier this month in Scientific Reports. The lead author is research associate Dr. Venkata Raveendra Pothineni.\n\nRELATED: THC Holds Promise As Possible First-of-Kind Treatment for Women With Endometriosis: Study\n\n\u201cWe have been screening potential drugs for six years,\u201d Pothineni said. \u201cWe\u2019ve screened almost 8,000 chemical compounds. We have tested 50 molecules in the dish. The most effective and safest molecules were tested in animal models. Along the way, I\u2019ve met many people suffering with this horrible, lingering disease. Our main goal is to find the best compound for treating patients and stop this disease.\u201d\n\nFrustrated by the lack of treatment options for Lyme disease patients with lingering symptoms, Rajadas and his team began hunting for a better alternative in 2011. In 2016, they published a study in Drug Design, Development and Therapy that listed 20 chemical compounds, from about 4,000, that were most effective at killing the infection in mice. All 20 had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for various uses. One, for instance, is used to treat alcohol abuse disorder.\n\nIn this most recent study, azlocillin, one of the top-20 contenders, was shown to eclipse a total of 7,450 compounds because it is more effective in killing B. burgdorferi and causes fewer side effects.\n\nMORE: Molecule Combo Actually Reverses Arthritis in Human Cartilage and Rats, Says \u2018Exciting\u2019 New Study\n\nLyme disease affects more than 300,000 people annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can affect various organs, including the brain, skin, heart, joints and nervous system, and cause heart problems and arthritis if untreated. Symptoms include fever, headaches, chills, and muscle and joint pain.\n\nTraditional antibiotics, such as doxycycline, are effective as an early course of treatment for the infection in the majority of patients, but it remains unclear why these drugs fail to treat 10% to 20% of patients, Rajadas said.\n\n\u201cSome researchers think this may be due to drug-tolerant bacteria living in the body and continuing to cause disease,\u201d said Rajadas, who is also a member of the Lyme Disease Working Group at Stanford. \u201cOthers believe it\u2019s an immune disorder caused by bacteria during the first exposure, which causes a perpetual inflammation condition. Whatever the cause, the pain for patients is still very real.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: Simple Type-2 Diabetes Treatment With Low Calorie Diet is So Effective, It Reverses the Disease in Studies\n\nThe drug, which is not on the market, was tested in mouse models of Lyme disease at seven-day, 14-day and 21-day intervals and found to eliminate the infection. For the first time, azlocillin was also shown to be effective in killing drug-tolerant forms of B. burgdorferi in lab dishes, indicating that it may work as a therapy for lingering symptoms of Lyme disease.\n\nPothineni and Rajadas have patented the compound for the treatment of Lyme disease and are working with a company to develop an oral form of the drug. Researchers plan to conduct a clinical trial.\n\nThe study was funded by the Bay Area Lyme Foundation and Laurel STEM Fund.\n\nReprinted from Stanford University\n\nCure Your Friends Of Negativity By Sharing The Good News To Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Businesses Are Giving Away All Their Excess Toilet Paper to People in Need During COVID-19 Shutdowns", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/businesses-giving-away-toilet-paper-during-covid-shutdowns/", "date": "2020-3-19", "transcript": "As supermarket shelves around the world are cleared of hand sanitizer and toilet paper amidst the COVID-19 outbreaks, businesses are taking it upon themselves to share their wealth with community members in need.\n\nAtlanta-based marketing firm Trevelino/Keller is just one of many companies that have temporarily closed down during the quarantine.

Now, however, Reuters reports that the declining rate of infection has continued to fall with less than 100 new cases reported for several days in a row.\n\n6) China Celebrates Several Milestones of Recovery After Temporary Hospitals Close and Parks Reopen\n\nCrowds of medical staffers and discharged patients were filmed celebrating the closure of all 14 temporary hospitals that opened in Wuhan to treat COVID-19 patients during the worst of the outbreak.\n\nAuthorities told the South China Morning Post this week that the virus had finally passed its peak as the nation\u2019s mainland experienced only 11 new cases on March 13th, most of which were from international travelers.\n\nAs the outbreak is finally brought under control, parks and tourist attractions are slowly beginning to reopen to the public under careful moderation.\n\n7) Australian Researchers Testing Two Drugs as Potential \u2018Cures\u2019 for the Virus\n\nAt the University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research, scientists have found that two different medications\u2014both of which are registered and available in Australia\u2014have completely wiped out traces of the disease in test tubes.\n\nNot only that, the drugs were given to some of the nation\u2019s first COVID-19 patients, which resulted in \u201cdisappearance of the virus and complete recovery from the infection,\u201d researchers told News.com.au.\n\nThe university is now looking to conduct a nationwide trial with the drugs to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of each drug administered separately and together.\n\n8) Uber Eats is Supporting the North American Restaurant Industry By Waiving Delivery Fees for 100,000 Restaurants\n\nAs restaurants across Canada and the United States are forced to temporarily shut down amidst COVID-19 outbreaks, Uber Eats has announced that they will be waiving delivery fees for independent restaurants.\n\n\u201cWe know the success of every restaurant depends on customer demand,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re working urgently to drive orders towards independent restaurants on Eats, to help make up for the significant slowdown of in-restaurant dining.\n\nNEW Podcast: Daily Inspiring Covid-19 Updates from Good News Gurus Under Quarantine\n\n\u201cAs more customers are choosing to stay indoors, we\u2019ve waived the Delivery Fee for the more than 100,000 independent restaurants across US and Canada on Uber Eats. We will also launch daily dedicated, targeted marketing campaigns\u2014both in-app and via email\u2014to promote delivery from local restaurants, especially those that are new to the app.\u201d\n\n9) Dutch and Canadian Researchers Are Reporting Additional Breakthrough Research on Treating the Virus\n\nScientists from Canada and the Netherlands have also made medical breakthroughs of their own. In Toronto, a team of researchers managed to isolate the agent responsible for the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which will help researchers around the world develop better diagnostic testing, treatments, and vaccines.\n\n\u201cResearchers from these world-class institutions came together in a grassroots way to successfully isolate the virus in just a few short weeks,\u201d said Dr. Rob Kozak, clinical microbiologist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. \u201cIt demonstrates the amazing things that can happen when we collaborate.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Dutch researchers have submitted a scientific paper for publishing on how they have identified an anti-body for the virus\u2014and it could be a world-first.\n\n10) Here Are a Bunch of Other Ways That People and Businesses Are Supporting Each Other Throughout the US Outbreak\n\nDollar General has announced that they will be devoting their opening hour of shopping time to elderly customers. Athletes and sports teams are pledging to pay the wages of arena employees during the shutdown. Utility companies, landlords, automakers, and internet providers are waiving a number of late fees and payments to ease the financial burden of the shutdown. School districts across the country are still opening their doors to serve meals to kids and families.\n\nAll in all, the pandemic situation may seem grim, but these are just a few examples of how businesses and individuals are still looking out for each other during times of trouble.\n\nNEW Podcast: Daily Inspiring Covid-19 Updates from Good News Gurus Under Quarantine\n\nMultiply The Good By Sharing The Positivity With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Corner Store Owner Gives Away More Than $6,000 in Free Goods to Seniors Preparing for Quarantines", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/store-gives-away-6000-dollars-in-free-goods-to-quarantined-seniors/", "date": "2020-3-16", "transcript": "A Scottish convenience store has given away thousands of dollars in free toilet paper, antibacterial handwash, tissues, and anti-inflammatories to seniors staying home amidst novel coronavirus warnings.\n\nCustomers over the age of 65 and those with mobility issues facing self-isolation can either pick up the free goods at the Day-Today convenience store in Drylaw, Edinburgh or have the \u201ccoronavirus kits\u201d delivered to their house for free by calling the shop.\n\n34-year-old shop owner Zahid Iqbal has already given away more than 1,000 kits, and he says he hopes it \u201csets a good example\u201d for other consumers and businesses as shop shelves have been left bare from panic-buying.\n\nRELATED: Woman Starts Doing Grocery Runs for Older Neighbors to Reduce Their Exposure to the Coronavirus\n\nSince each pack costs around \u00a35 to make, Iqbal said the initiative has already cost his business a whopping \u00a35,000 ($6,100) not including the cost of fuel for home deliveries.\n\nHe is also considering making food bags, with pasta and tinned goods, as panic buying leaves store shelves empty and supermarkets struggle to meet demand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve given away more than a thousand now, that\u2019s just over the weekend,\u201d says Iqbal. \u201cIt\u2019s a time when we need to stick together.\u201d\n\nThe idea came to Iqbal while accompanying his parents to a local supermarket, where they encountered a shocking number of empty shelves.\n\n\u201cWe have lots of customers from the local care homes, as well as disabled customers, who can\u2019t get hand sanitizers, loo rolls or anything at all.\n\nLOOK: 18-Year-Old Drove 225 Miles to Make Pizzeria\u2019s First and Only Delivery After Receiving Special Phone Call\n\n\u201cWe just want to set a good example in this world.\u201d\n\nThe family-run store, which currently employs five people, has served the local community for more than 15 years\u2014and although they have received a flood of requests for the coronavirus kids, Iqbal believes his loyal customers are worth every penny during these times of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cI had to get staff in to do deliveries, and petrol\u2019s not included,\u201d said Iqbal. \u201cWe\u2019ve done quite a few deliveries to people who can\u2019t get out and collecting.

Because of that, our top media outlets have been incentivized to publish the most triggering aspects of society.\n\nFor a long time, I strayed away from the news. Not because I didn\u2019t want to be informed\u2014I did. I just really couldn\u2019t stand waking up every day to the worst aspects of the world.\n\nRecently, though, I decided to dive back in head-first and start publishing a 10 minute daily news segment on my podcast.\n\nI wanted to offer an alternative dialogue\u2014not just by sharing uplifting stories, but by also going head-first into current events and still coming out with inspiring and empowering perspectives.\n\nRELATED: How the Animals All Around You Can Help You Love Your Life\n\nI won\u2019t lie.

Back in college, when I used to watch, read, or listen to the news, I\u2019d be overcome with sadness at the state of the world. I\u2019d think, \u201cHow could this be happening? We should be further along than this.\u201d\n\nBut recently, with further reflection on ideas like, \u201cAll suffering is simply arguing with reality,\u201d I decided to attempt to re-enter the news with that perspective. I hoped to stay empowered and full by setting the intention of complete acceptance of all of it.\n\nIf everything in the news is truly a part of the world we live in, I saw an opportunity to increase my capacity to be with that reality\u2014and accept it.\n\nLOOK: 27-Year-old With Terminal Cancer Pens Heartfelt Letter on Why You Should Change Your Life\n\nThat\u2019s where I began the journey, but as I mentioned, after just a couple of weeks, I was already feeling drained and having trouble finding that place of acceptance.\n\nThen came this idea in meditation: \u201cThe news isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s awareness.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when it all clicked into place.\n\nI had trouble accepting the news when I believed it was all happening suddenly out of nowhere.

But no significant associations emerged for overall stroke risk and water temperature.\n\nCHECK OUT: These are the 3 Most Promising Longevity Supplements From Scientific Research So Far\n\nAfter excluding those participants who developed cardiovascular disease within 5 or 10 years of the start of the study, the associations found weren\u2019t quite as strong, but nevertheless still remained statistically significant.\n\nThis is an observational study, and as such, can\u2019t establish cause, added to which changes in bathing frequency weren\u2019t tracked during the monitoring period. The typical style of Japanese bathing also includes immersion to shoulder height, and this may be a critical factor.\n\nBut, say the researchers, previously published research has pointed to a link between heat exposure and cardiovascular disease prevention: this is because the effects of heat on the body are not dissimilar to those of exercise.\n\nRELATED: Largest Study of Its Kind Identifies the Surprising Health Benefits of Fasting Every Other Day\n\n\u201cWe found that frequent tub bathing was significantly associated with a lower risk of hypertension, suggesting that a beneficial effect of tub bathing on risk of [cardiovascular disease] may in part be due to a reduced risk of developing hypertension,\u201d write the researchers.\n\nThey acknowledge that taking a hot bath is not without its risk, particularly if the temperature is too high, a point that is taken up by Dr. Andrew Felix Burden in a linked editorial.\n\nReprinted from BMJ\n\nBe Sure And Share This Heart-Handy Research With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "After Rediscovering Warehouse Treasure Trove of 50,000 Face Masks, IKEA Donates Them All to Hospital", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/ikea-donates-50k-face-masks-to-swedish-hospital/", "date": "2020-3-19", "transcript": "As world healthcare systems clamor to keep up with medical supply demands amidst the COVID-19 outbreaks, an IKEA in Sweden has become an unexpected benefactor of the nation\u2019s biggest hospital.\n\nEarlier this week, employees at the Stockholm location were reportedly stunned to discover a stash of more than 50,000 medical face masks gathering dust in their warehouse.\n\nThe store had purchased the masks during the most recent bird flu outbreak.

Our findings show that the success of stem cell transplantation as a cure for HIV, first reported nine years ago in the Berlin patient, can be replicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that this curative treatment is high-risk, and only used as a last resort for patients with HIV who also have life-threatening haematological malignancies,\u201d he added. \u201cTherefore, this is not a treatment that would be offered widely to patients with HIV who are on successful antiretroviral treatment.\u201d\n\nWhile most HIV patients can manage the virus with current treatment options and have the possibility of living a long and healthy life, experimental research of this kind following patients who have undergone high-risk, last-resort curative treatments, can provide insight into how a more widely applicable cure might be developed in the future.\n\nMORE: After Her Years of Research, a Cambridge Scientist Could Be on the Verge of Curing Multiple Sclerosis\n\nIn 2011, another patient based in Berlin (the \u201cBerlin patient\u201d) was the first HIV patient to be reported cured of the virus three and half years after undergoing similar treatment. Their treatment included total body irradiation, two rounds of stem cell transplant from a donor who carried a gene that is resistant to HIV, and a chemotherapy drug regimen. The transplant aims to make the virus unable to replicate in the patient\u2019s body by replacing the patient\u2019s immune cells with those of the donors, whilst the body irradiation and chemotherapy targets any residual HIV virus.\n\nThe patient reported in this study (the \u201cLondon patient\u201d), underwent one stem-cell transplantation, a reduced-intensity chemotherapy drug regimen, without whole body irradiation. In 2019, it was reported that their HIV was in remission, and this study provides follow-up viral load blood test results at 30-months and a modeling analysis to predict the chances of viral re-emergence.\n\nUltrasensitive viral load sampling from the London patient\u2019s cerebrospinal fluid, intestinal tissue, or lymphoid tissue was taken at 29 months after interruption of ART and viral load sampling of their blood at 30 months. At 29 months, CD4 cell count (indicators of immune system health and stem cell transplantation success) was measured, and the extent to which the patient\u2019s immune cells have been replaced by those derived from the transplant.\n\nResults showed no active viral infection was detected in samples of the patient\u2019s blood at 30 months, or in their cerebrospinal fluid, semen, intestinal tissue, and lymphoid tissue 29 months after stopping ART.\n\nWATCH: He Was Called Foolish for His Research; Now Documentary Tells How He Won Nobel Prize for \u2018Cancer Cure\u2019\n\nThe patient had a healthy CD4 cell count, suggesting they have recovered well from the transplant, with their CD4 cells replaced by cells derived from the HIV-resistant transplanted stem cells.\n\nFurthermore, 99% of the patient\u2019s immune cells were derived from the donor\u2019s stem cells, indicating the stem-cell transplant had been successful.\n\nSince it was not possible to measure proportion of cells derived from the donor\u2019s stem cells in all parts of the patient\u2019s body (i.e. measurement was not possible in some tissue cells like lymph nodes), the authors used a modeling analysis to predict the probability of cure based on two possible scenarios. If 80% of patient\u2019s cells are derived from the transplant, the probability of cure is predicted at 98%; whereas if they have 90% donor derived cells, they predict a 99% probability of cure.\n\nMORE: First Sickle Cell Disease Patient Treated With Gene-Edited Cells Experiences Significant Improvement\n\nComparing to the treatment used on the Berlin patient, the authors highlight that their case study of the London patient represents a step towards a less intensive treatment approach, showing that the long-term remission of HIV can be achieved using reduced intensity drug regimens, with one stem cell transplant (rather than two) and without total body irradiation.\n\nHowever, being only the second reported patient to undergo this experimental treatment successfully, the authors note that that the London patient will need continued, but much less frequent, monitoring for re-emergence of the virus.\n\nThat being said, the London patient\u2014Adam Castillejo\u2014has gone public with his identity in hopes that he can be a positive role model for other people living with HIV.\n\nReprinted from The Lancet\n\nDoing my best to try and embrace my new path as an Ambassador of Hope @londonpatient https://t.co/OZSQb2dWM5 \u2014 Londonpatient_HOPE (@londonpatient) March 9, 2020\n\nCure Your Friends Of Negativity By Sharing The Good News To Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "New Positive Podcast \u2013 Inspiring Daily COVID Updates from Geri & Anthony!", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/episode-2-podcast-with-some-inspiring-covid-19-updates-from-geri-anthony/", "date": "2020-3-18", "transcript": "Episode #4 of our quarantine-inspired podcast just dropped\u2014and we are doing shows every few days during this COVID-19 craziness, as the perfect antidote to today\u2019s 24-hour cable news.\n\nJoin Geri and Anthony as they talk about the \u2018corona kindness\u2019 breaking out all over the world, the silver linings, pandemic-positives, and the most exciting breakthroughs in technology, business, and health this week.\n\nListen and Subscribe to Episodes on iTunes\u2014or Spotify, here \u2014 or, on Podbean\u2026\n\nOur Good News Gurus are bringing you the most inspiring positive news from the last few days, like a breakthrough company that uses recycled aluminum instead of batteries to store solar energy; and a new treatment for lyme disease (and other good news).\n\nEmail Us: We\u2019d love to share your story, answer questions, or interview you on the show: [email protected]\n\nGo Listen and Subscribe to Episodes on iTunes\u2014or Spotify, here \u2014 or, on Podbean\u2026\n\nGood News Network Founder Geri Weis-Corbley along with GNN co-owner Anthony Samadani will be recording a couple episodes each week to serve their fans with a reassuring and uplifting focus.

It had been 25 years since the couple lived in the city, but despite the distance, the fabled restaurant still set the bar for the perfect slice of pizza.\n\n\u201cWe were young and money was tight, but every pay day, Rich would pick up Steve\u2019s Pizza for dinner,\u201d Julie wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly describe how delicious this pizza is\u2014but several moves and all these years later, it is still the gold standard and we\u2019ve never found a better pizza yet.

New Research Says Squatting or Kneeling May Have Far More Health Benefits Than Sitting Down", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/squatting-and-kneeling-healthier-than-sitting-down/", "date": "2020-3-12", "transcript": "Standing desks are so pass\u00e9\u2014it\u2019s time for squatting desks.\n\nA USC-led study shows that squatting and kneeling were important resting positions in human evolution\u2014and may be important for modern human health.\n\nSitting for hours a day is linked to some health risks, including cardiovascular disease, likely because it involves low muscle activity and low muscle metabolism. However, these risks seem paradoxical. For humans, evolutionary pressures favor conserving energy. Spending a lot of time sitting would seem to accomplish that goal. So, why should sitting be so harmful?\n\nMORE: Never Too Late\u2014New Study Finds Lungs \u2018Magically\u2019 Repair Themselves After Quitting Smoking, No Matter the Age\n\nThe USC-led team has shown that resting postures used before the invention of chairs\u2014like squatting and kneeling\u2014may hold the answer, as they involve higher levels of muscle activity then chair-sitting. These more active rest postures may help protect people from the harmful effects of inactivity.\n\n\u201cWe tend to think human physiology is adapted to the conditions in which we evolved,\u201d said David Raichlen, a professor of biological sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. \u201cSo, we assumed that if inactivity is harmful, our evolutionary history would not have included much time spent sitting the way we do today.\u201d\n\nThe study was published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nHow you rest matters\n\nTo better understand the evolution of sedentary behaviors, the scientists studied inactivity in a group of Tanzanian hunter-gatherers, the Hadza, who have a lifestyle that is similar in some ways with how humans lived in the past.\n\nFor the study, Hadza participants wore devices that measured physical activity and periods of rest. The scientists found that they had high levels of physical activity\u2014over three times as much as the 22 minutes per day advised by U.S. federal health guidelines.\n\nBut the scientists also found that they had high levels of inactivity.\n\nIn fact, the Hadza are sedentary for about as much time\u2014around 9 to 10 hours per day\u2014as humans in more developed countries. However, they appear to lack the markers of chronic diseases that are associated, in industrialized societies, with long periods of sitting. The reason for this disconnect may lie in how they rest.\n\nRELATED: These are the 3 Most Promising Longevity Supplements From Scientific Research So Far\n\n\u201cEven though there were long periods of inactivity, one of the key differences we noticed is that the Hadza are often resting in postures that require their muscles to maintain light levels of activity\u2014either in a squat or kneeling,\u201d Raichlen said.\n\nIn addition to tracking activity and inactivity, the researchers used specialized equipment to measure muscle activity in the lower limbs in different resting postures. Squatting involved more muscle activity compared to sitting.\n\nThe researchers suggested that because the Hadza squat and kneel and have high levels of movement when not at rest, they may have more consistent muscle activity throughout the day. This could reduce the health risks associated with sedentary behavior.\n\n\u201cBeing a couch potato\u2014or even sitting in an office chair\u2014requires less muscle activity than squatting or kneeling,\u201d Raichlen said. \u201cSince light levels of muscle activity require fuel, which generally means burning fats, then squatting and kneeling postures may not be as harmful as sitting in chairs.\u201d\n\nIn developed countries, humans spend inactive periods sitting on their duffs in chairs, recliners or sofas, so the only time they activate their leg muscles is when they bend their knees to slide into the seat. On average, people in more industrialized societies, including the United States and Europe, spend about nine hours per day sitting.\n\n\u201cPreferences or behaviors that conserve energy have been key to our species\u2019 evolutionary success,\u201d said Brian Wood, an anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has worked with the Hazda people for 16 years. \u201cBut when environments change rapidly, these same preferences can lead to less optimal outcomes. Prolonged sitting is one example.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: Keep Your Eyes in Good Shape With These 4 Simple Ocular Stretches for Computer Users\n\nThe scientists dubbed this the \u201cInactivity Mismatch Hypothesis.\u201d\n\n\u201cReplacing chair sitting and associated muscular inactivity with more sustained active rest postures may represent a behavioral paradigm that should be explored in future experimental work,\u201d they wrote. Resolving this inactivity mismatch with our evolutionary past could pay off in better health today.\n\n\u201cSquatting is not a likely alternative,\u201d Raichlen said, \u201cbut spending more time in postures that at least require some low-level muscle activity could be good for our health.\u201d\n\nReprinted from University of Southern California\n\nBe Sure And Share The Intriguing Health News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "This Athlete Could Become the First American Amputee to Compete in the Olympics", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/he-could-become-first-american-amputee-to-compete-in-olympics/", "date": "2020-3-12", "transcript": "Blake Leeper has never let his lack of legs prevent him from pursuing his passion for sports\u2014and now, he is fighting to become the first American amputee to participate in the Olympics.\n\nSince Leeper discovered his passion for track and field in college, he has gone on to become a Paralympic champion and international silver- and bronze-medalist.\n\nDespite these achievements the 30-year-old double amputee has been denied a chance to compete for Team USA in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics alongside able-bodied athletes because the World Athletics ruled that his prosthetic running blades gave him an unfair advantage over his competitors.\n\nRELATED: He Built His Own Prosthetic Out of LEGOS and Hopes to Provide Cheap Solutions for Others Who Need a Hand\n\nHowever, Leeper will not be deterred\u2014he has filed for an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to let him compete.\n\n\u201cWorld Athletics\u2019s decision to bar me from participating in the World Championships was a blow to all disabled athletes, but I will not be deterred.

When salt marshes, shallow water seagrass beds, river estuaries, and tidal zones are healthy, these delicate ecosystems work like the tiles of a mosaic to create the picture of resilient seas and shores.\n\nBut, the losses of the crucial seagrass piece is coming to a head in Wales, where Dr. Richard Unsworth of Swansea University, unnerved by the annual decline of 7% in seagrass beds around the UK and Ireland, has worked to organize a massive replanting effort along the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly productive and just sucks carbon into the sediments, traps particles that are locked there for millennia,\u201d Dr. Unsworth told BBC. \u201cThat means that carbon dioxide is not in the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Whales Feces Represent One of the Greatest Allies Against Climate Change\u2014Even More Than Trees\n\nAccording to WWF\u2019s article 10 Reasons to Hope, seagrass can capture carbon 35 times faster than even tropical rainforests, but as it currently covers merely 0.2% of the seafloor, the potential to use more seagrass as a carbon offset is unlimited.\n\nIn preparation for this undertaking, 750,000 seagrass seeds were collected from various meadows around the UK last summer and stored in the laboratory at Swansea University.\n\nThose seeds were transferred into small pouches sewn together from natural materials, and work has begun on lowering these seeds down onto the ocean floor off the coast of Dale Fort to create a 20,000-square-meter meadow (5 acres).\n\nLOOK: You Can Now \u2018Reforest the Oceans\u2019 One Online Search at a Time Thanks to This New Search Engine\n\nSeagrass is also imperative as a haven for wildlife, providing shelter, food, and a place to raise young for all kinds of marine species\u2014as a video from the BBC demonstrates. Seagrass also acts as a nursery for important fish stocks like cod and pollock, and prevents seafloor erosion from storm surges.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Unsworth stressed the need for hundreds of thousands of acres of seagrass beds, salt marshes, and other coastal ecosystems because of the unique potential they have for tackling local, regional, and\u2014inevitably\u2014global environmental concerns, and for self-cleaning the seas themselves.\n\nPlant Some Positivity By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "CDC Director Commits to Free Coronavirus Testing for Anyone in the US Regardless of Insurance", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/us-congresswoman-secures-confirmation-for-free-coronavirus-testing/", "date": "2020-3-13", "transcript": "In a hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday, a congresswoman managed to secure a verbal confirmation from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that he would use his power under law to make coronavirus testing free for all Americans.\n\nRep.

An alternative to this is to store the energy generated from the sun during the day in batteries, but along with representing a serious recycling problem, batteries require rare-earth minerals that are obtained from environmentally-destructive mining operations.\n\n\u201cBatteries are very expensive to store power for a 24 hour period,\u201d says Jonas Eklind, CEO of Azelio, the Swedish energy startup that has potentially solved this problem for good. \u201cIf you want to store a lot of renewable energy, the most cost efficient way of storing this is thermal energy.\u201d\n\nIn the always forward-thinking countries of Scandinavia, Azelio adapted an old Volvo assembly line factory to manufacture their patented, industry-first thermal energy storage system that will allow people to keep the energy that their standard PV solar panels generate during the day so they can use it in evenings.\n\nAnd, instead of the critical energy storage component using rare and expensive minerals, the Azelio system uses recycled aluminum, which emits nothing, is much cheaper than lithium, and\u2014as Jonas joked during an interview with GNN\u2014\u201conly lasts 62,000 years.\u201d\n\nMolten Aluminum can Save the Earth\n\nThe former CEO of a battery company, Jonas helped start this remarkable energy storage project in 2016 when he came onboard, around the same time Azelio was looking into thermal storage technology.\n\nLOOK: New Power Plant Doubles as a Ski Slope and Climbing Wall (and Turns Waste into Energy)\n\n\u201cWhen we started the project, we had a conversion unit that converts high temperatures into electricity,\u201d he said. This device was called a Stirling Generator, and at first they would use biogas from landfills, water purification units\u2014or from manure in a combustion engine to generate electricity\u2014but after running numerous computer simulations on cost and energy capacity, determined that aluminum was the best choice.\n\nPhotons absorbed by solar panels on your roof enter into the system where an aluminum alloy is heated so it moves from a solid to a liquid. This allows for the storage of an incredibly dense amount of energy within the material which can be sent as heat into the Stirling Generator and turned into electricity on demand, with zero emissions and at a lower cost.\n\nThis is in direct contrast to fossil fuels, uranium rods or pellets, or diesel fuel, because the energy in the aluminum can constantly be melted and hardened again to produce or store energy.\n\nWith its high energy density, the material has the ability to store energy for an extended period of time, while the aluminum suffers no degradation in capacity over time.\n\nCHECK OUT: Working in Secret, Bill Gates-Backed Solar Company Reveals Tech That Could Spell the End of Fossil Fuels\n\nVersatile yet Stable\n\nThe technology would prove to be ideal in parts of the world where grid reliability is low, like in Southern Africa where Jonas estimates that people only have access to a stable power grid 45% of the time.\n\nAzelio\u2019s thermal storage would allow for people to implement solar into a community, an industry, or just their homes, to defend against failing or unreliable grids, which Jonas says is becoming more and more normal even in the developed world. In his home country of Sweden, during the long winter, trees knock out power all the time, forcing rural communities to switch to diesel generators or similar interventions\u2014sometimes for weeks.\n\nWATCH: After 5 Years of Drought, Kenyan Region Finally Gets Clean Water Thanks to Solar-Powered Saltwater Plant\n\n\u201cOur system can give you decentralized power based on solar and wind so you can build a local micro-grid that provides you with almost everything you need 24 hours a day,\u201d said Jonas.\n\nAnd one of the really exceptional things about Azelio\u2019s system is that, in theory, it\u2019s as scalable as necessary; from 100 kilowatts per-hour, up to 100 megawatts per-hour, and more. Though it is maximized for solar power, it can easily work the same way for tidal or hydropower, biofuels, and wind.\n\nMost city or town grids are split up into multiple components that feed off of, support, and borrow from one another to remain stable. Like normal solar power that utilizes energy from from the sun and sells the excess into the grid before later buying back from the grid at nighttime, Azelio\u2019s thermal storage can fit into the baseload power of a modern established grid as much or as little as is required\u2014whether that\u2019s 10% of total power needs or 90%.\n\nLOOK: Three-Story \u2018Water Battery\u2019 Has Already Slashed University\u2019s Electrical Costs By 40% in One Month\n\nAzelio is conducting three verification tests this year\u2014first, in their home country of Sweden, and two others in partnership with renewable energy companies. On March 5th, they inaugurated their thermal storage technology at the massive Noor solar power complex in Morocco, teaming up with Masen, and later this year, they will launch in Abu Dhabi with Masdar. In addition to these, Azelio has received various customer enquiries of a potential value in excess of 16 billion euro, including one customer in California who wants the system both for wind and solar energy.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, with what we have promised to the market for the cost of electricity coming out of the system, we can possibly compete with large scale installations where we need to power a whole city.\u201d\n\nPower Up Your Social Media Feed With Positivity \u2014 SHARE it\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "They\u2019re Fixing The World\u2019s Plastic Problem Using \u2018The Milkman\u2019 Concept \u2013 With All Your Favorite Products", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/fixing-the-worlds-plastic-problem-using-the-milkman-concept/", "date": "2020-3-11", "transcript": "For several generations of young Americans, the idea of a \u2018milkman\u2019 is a completely foreign concept.

The cost of processing the meat is covered by numerous sponsors, including sportsman\u2019s groups like Missouri Chapter National Wild Turkey, government departments like the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC), and charity organizations like the Missouri Food Banks Association.\n\n\u201cHunters started Share the Harvest because they saw a need in their communities,\u201d said MDC Director Sara Parker Pauley in a statement. \u201dAnd hunters remain the driving force behind this popular program that helps feed our fellow Missourians who are in need.\u201d\n\nShare the Harvest is coordinated by the MDC and the Conservation Federation of Missouri. Launched in 1992, it has seen 4.3 million pounds of venison ground, packaged and sent off to ensure that people not only have something to eat, but something that is of exceptional nutritional value.\n\nBecause there are 1.4 million whitetail deer in Missouri alone, each year around 38,000 vehicles collide with the animals along Missouri\u2019s roads.

Researchers like Dr. David Sinclair, Dr. Rhonda Patrick, Dr. Eric Verdin, and others have catapulted the field from one that was secondary to other lifespan-focused fields like those dedicated to helping reduce cancer or diabetes, into one of the most exciting and interdisciplinary areas of study today.\n\nSo far, the ever-expanding research into longevity has yielded a shopping list of benefits\u2014from limiting age-related decline in the eyes, to reducing all-cause mortality.\n\nAlong with research into simple lifestyle interventions like sleep, exercise, and sauna use, certain specific nutritional elements, notably a select few known as \u201cNAD+ boosters,\u201d are being looked at and now commercially sold, as a potentially effective treatment for a condition that\u2019s very old but also very new: aging.\n\nCHECK OUT: When Blueberries and Grapes Are Combined, a Dramatic Decline in Memory Loss and Aging \u2013 Study\n\nNAD+ boosters, like nicotinamide riboside (NR), and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), as well as the compound resveratrol\u2014produced in plants, notably red grapes, during periods of stress\u2014can now all be purchased in supplement form commercially.\n\nWhat might a longevity supplement do for you? We know it has shown a variety of benefits in scientific studies of both humans and rodents.\n\nNicotinamide riboside\n\nOf all the NAD+ boosters\u2014compounds which either convert directly into, or contribute in some way to the process of creating the nutritional element\u2014nicotinamide riboside (NR) has been the most extensively studied, mostly in animals.\n\nIn one study, mice who were fed a diet high in both sugar and fat in order to quickly create obesity, gained less body fat and demonstrated increased insulin sensitivity when taking an orally-administered dose of NR.\n\nMORE: Plant Compounds Used to Successfully Treat Alzheimer\u2019s in Mice Now Shown to Prevent Other Effects of Aging\n\nMice receiving the same size dose of NR as the obesity study (400mg per kilo of bodyweight) were also found in another study to have reversed mitochondrial damage and increased mitochondrial biogenesis, the process through which mitochondria are created.\n\nFinally, benefits to the brain from NR supplementation were also confirmed in rodents, including neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and reduced beta-amyloid build up in the brain, which is a strong indicator of Alzheimer\u2019s risk.\n\n\u201cWhether taking nicotinamide riboside will have the same effects on delaying aging or improving mitochondrial function in humans as it does in animals is unknown,\u201d writes longevity expert Dr. Rhonda Patrick on her blog. \u201cHowever, when people with type 2 diabetes took a nicotinic acid derivative (an NAD+ precursor), they exhibited improvements in mitochondrial function in their skeletal muscle as well as increased NAD+ levels in their muscles.\u201d\n\nLOOK: Keep Your Eyes in Good Shape With These 4 Simple Ocular Stretches for Computer Users\n\nNicotinamide mononucleotide\n\nWhile not studied as thoroughly as NR, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has also been shown to reduce some effects produced by aging.\n\nIn separate mouse studies, injections of 500mg per kilo of bodyweight were found to have beneficial effects in countering symptoms of obesity, particularly in improving insulin sensitivity and NAD+ levels in the liver and muscle, and also several markers of cardiovascular disease related to dysfunction of the heart.\n\nMORE: Never Too Late\u2014New Study Finds Lungs \u2018Magically\u2019 Repair Themselves After Quitting Smoking, No Matter the Age\n\nAs we age, levels of NAD+ decrease in tissues over time, which experts believe is a key factor in age-related decline in the muscles, heart, brain, liver, and other organs.\n\nStarting at 5 months of age, one mouse cohort was split into two groups and fed a diet that included 100 and 300 mg per kilo of bodyweight of NMN for 12 months respectively.\n\n\u201cThe mice that were fed nicotinamide mononucleotide had improved skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, increased energy expenditure, increased bone density and decreased insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner,\u201d writes Rhonda. (Dose dependency refers to the amount of NMN consumed relating to the gravitas of the observed effect.)\n\nFor instance in the case of the mouse cohort, 100mg of NMN in the diet resulted in a 4% reduction in age-associated weight gain, while the 300mg group experienced a 9% reduction. Remarkably, it was also shown to increase or fortify energy metabolism, eye function, insulin sensitivity, while reducing age associated gene expression.\n\nResveratrol\n\nShort of your bartender explaining to you why this or that particular bottle of red wine is good for your heart, resveratrol is only recently beginning to be explored as a potential longevity compound. It exists in the seeds, fruits, skins, leaves, stems, and other parts of a variety of plants, and is created during periods of stress on the plant.\n\nThis is why red wine is noted as having heart-healthy or antioxidant effects on the body. During the winemaking process, the stressed parts of the grape confer resveratrol into the beverage, however it\u2019s likely negligible amounts.\n\nIn a study where healthy individuals were given a 6-week course of 40mg of resveratrol derived from the extract of a plant called Japanese knotweed, multiple anti-inflammatory effects were observed. Reductions in pro-inflammatory markers such as cytokines TNF-Alpha and IL-6, as well as the concentrations of oxidants were noted after the trial.\n\nRELATED: Training for Your First Marathon \u2018Reverses\u2019 Aging of Major Blood Vessels on Par With Medication\n\nIL-6 and TNF-Alpha contribute significantly to declines associated with aging, with TNF-Alpha being correlated with possibly every disease known to man.\n\nThe most significant way in which resveratrol acts to improve longevity is through sirtuin activation. World at Large reported in January: \u201cSirtuins use NAD+ to control the genes involved in some of the most critical systems in our biology including energy metabolism, circadian rhythms, autophagy, DNA repair, and cell survival\u2026\u201d\n\nSirtuins play a role in insulin release, lipid mobilization, stress responses, and lifespan modulation, and mimic many of the beneficial effects observed in calorie-restriction, another longevity-based field of research. Dr. Patrick explains on her website how caloric restriction has been widely-shown to increase healthspan and lifespan in organisms from bacteria to primates.\n\nMORE: Managing Your Gut Bacteria Shown to Alleviate Anxiety, Says New Research\n\nA study in Nature involving yeast showed that \u201cresveratrol mimics calorie restriction by stimulating sirtuin-2, increasing DNA stability and extending lifespan by 70%.\u201d\n\nTaking resveratrol in supplement form must be done with a little more application than other supplements. Dr. Patrick has collected much of the resveratrol research on her website, including how the bioavailability of resveratrol was shown to be higher with a moderate fat breakfast than with a high fat breakfast and how resveratrol is safe in humans in doses as high as 5 grams.\n\nFinally, in a conversation between Dr. Patrick and Harvard Professor of Genetics Dr. David Sinclair, the latter recommends the storing of resveratrol in a cold dark environment at all times.\n\nContinue exploring this topic \u2014 Maybe You\u2019ve Heard of NAD+: Here\u2019s Why it\u2019s Important and Why Everyone\u2019s Talking About It\n\nTell Your Friends to Live Longer by Sharing This On Social Media!", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Watch the Adorable Moment a Little Girl in Star Wars Costume Gets to Meet Her Hero BB-8 Droid in Real Life", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/watch-girl-in-bb8-costume-meet-droid-in-real-life/", "date": "2020-3-11", "transcript": "A little girl\u2019s determination to wear her BB-8 costume to a theme park earned her some celebrity friends.

His parents were told that he only had a 50% chance of survival, and he underwent 11 surgeries before he was even two years old.\n\nDespite being faced with these grim odds, he survived his prognosis. Not only that, he exhibited an extraordinary gift for playing the piano since before he could even walk; by the time he was 3 years old, he was playing two-handed piano compositions and writing his own songs without ever having a teacher.\n\nThe piano prodigy from Hackensack, New Jersey can now play anything he hears\u2014from Dvorak to Beyonce, his repertoire is immense and fluid.\n\nRELATED: Blind Man Develops Smart Cane That Uses Google Maps and Sensors to Identify One\u2019s Surroundings\n\nDalia Sakas, the director of New York\u2019s Filomen M.

I fulfilled that promise,\u201d Mendl told USA Today. \u201cShe was shocked at first but more impressed that I kept my promise from 5 years ago.\u201d\n\nTo Mendl\u2019s delight, Shocky quickly became a beloved part of the wedding ceremony. In addition to the barnyard critter sitting politely throughout the wedding ceremony, he also posed for photos with the other wedding guests.\n\nMendl later posted a photo of his sister\u2019s initial reaction to Shocky\u2019s arrival to Reddit\u2014and it has since been shared thousands of times across social media.\n\nAlthough Riva was gracious about her brother\u2019s gag, she says she does plan on getting him back during his graduation ceremony from the University of Akron in the fall. Mendl has agreed that this is only fair, but he has requested that his sister refrain from pulling any kind of prank or surprise while his name is being called for his diploma.\n\nBe Sure And Share This Amusing Story With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "3 Ways to Deal With the Anxiety of a New Situation \u2013 Those FFTs of Life (\u2018Effing First Times)", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/dr-brene-brown-on-ffts/", "date": "2020-4-8", "transcript": "The Lesson: If you have been stressing out amidst the chaos of quarantine, then you may need to listen to this podcast about FFTs (\u201c\u2019effing first times!\u201d)\u2014that is, how hard it is to be new at things, from small incidents to global pandemics.

They can quickly store large amounts of energy within a small battery-sized device and then supply energy to charge electronic devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and laptops, within a few seconds,\u201d explained Gomes.\n\nMORE: The Guys Who Sell Ocean Plastic Bracelets Are Closing in on 8 Million Pounds of Waste Pulled From the Sea\n\n\u201cCompared to batteries, super-capacitors are not only able to charge devices very quickly but also in orders of magnitude greater charging cycles than conventional devices.\n\n\u201cThe current super-capacitors are made from activated carbon which are nowhere near as efficient as the ones prepared during this project.\u201d\n\nWhy durian and jack fruit?\n\n\u201cDurian waste was selected based on the excellent template nature provides for making porous aerogels,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cThe durian and jack-fruit super-capacitors perform much better than the materials currently in use and are comparable, if not better, than the expensive and exotic graphene-based materials.\n\nCHECK OUT: Company Collects 80% of City\u2019s Recyclable Plastics and Turns It All into Lumber\n\n\u201cDurian waste, as a zero-cost substance that the community wants to get rid of urgently due to its repulsive, nauseous smell, is a sustainable source that can transform the waste into a product to substantially reduce the cost of energy storage through our chemical-free, green synthesis protocol.\u201d\n\nWhat could this technology be used for?\n\n\u201cWe have reached a point where we must urgently discover and produce ways to create and store energy using sustainably-sourced materials that do not contribute to global warming,\u201d said Associate Professor Gomes.\n\n\u201cConfronted with this and the world\u2019s rapidly depleting supplies of fossil fuels, naturally-derived super-capacitors are leading the way for developing high efficiency energy storage devices.\u201d\n\nReprinted from the University of Sydney\n\nPower Up With Positivity By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Ni\u00f1o Ruso Pinta Asombrosos Retratos de Mascotas a Cambio de Donaciones a los Refugios de Animales Locales", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nino-ruso-pinta-para-animales-de-refugio/", "date": "2020-3-27", "transcript": "Welcome!

The approach involves tiny muscle grafts and machine learning algorithms borrowed from the brain-machine interface field.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest advance in motor control for people with amputations in many years,\u201d said Paul Cederna, who is the Robert Oneal Collegiate Professor of Plastic Surgery at the U-M Medical School, as well as a professor of biomedical engineering.\n\n\u201cWe have developed a technique to provide individual finger control of prosthetic devices using the nerves in a patient\u2019s residual limb. With it, we have been able to provide some of the most advanced prosthetic control that the world has seen.\u201d\n\nLOOK: Teen Can Return to School After Undergoing Free Surgery to Correct Her Extreme Bow-Leggedness\n\nCederna co-leads the research with Cindy Chestek, associate professor of biomedical engineering at the U-M College of Engineering. In a paper published this week in Science Translational Medicine, they describe results with four study participants using the Mobius Bionics LUKE arm.\n\nIntuitive prosthetic control works on the first try\n\n\u201cYou can make a prosthetic hand do a lot of things, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the person is intuitively controlling it. The difference is when it works on the first try just by thinking about it, and that\u2019s what our approach offers,\u201d Chestek said. \u201cThis worked the very first time we tried it. There\u2019s no learning for the participants. All of the learning happens in our algorithms. That\u2019s different from other approaches.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: After Watching Brother Give Up on Gardening, Man Designs Tabletop Gardens for People in Wheelchairs\n\nWhile study participants aren\u2019t yet allowed to take the arm home, in the lab, they were able to pick up blocks with a pincer grasp; move their thumb in a continuous motion, rather than have to choose from two positions; lift spherically shaped objects; and even play in a version of Rock, Paper, Scissors called Rock, Paper, Pliers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you have a hand again,\u201d said study participant Joe Hamilton, who lost his arm in a fireworks accident in 2013. \u201cYou can pretty much do anything you can do with a real hand with that hand. It brings you back to a sense of normalcy.\u201d\n\nTurning a tiny muscle graft into a nerve signal amplifier\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles in mind-controlled prosthetics is tapping into a strong and stable nerve signal to feed the bionic limb. Some research groups\u2014those working in the brain-machine interface field\u2014go all the way to the primary source, the brain. This is necessary when working with people who are paralyzed. But it\u2019s invasive and high-risk.\n\nFor people with amputations, peripheral nerves\u2014the network that fans out from the brain and spinal cord\u2014have been interesting, but they hadn\u2019t yet led to a long-term solution for a couple of reasons: The nerve signals they carry are small. And other approaches to picking up those signals involved probes that eavesdropped by force. These \u201cnails in nerves,\u201d as researchers sometimes refer to them, lead to scar tissue, which muddles that already faint signal over time.\n\nThe U-M team came up with a better way. They wrapped tiny muscle grafts around the nerve endings in the participants\u2019 arms. These \u201cregenerative peripheral nerve interfaces,\u201d or RPNIs, offer severed nerves new tissue to latch on to. This prevents the growth of nerve masses called neuromas that lead to phantom limb pain. And it gives the nerves a megaphone. The muscle grafts amplify the nerve signals. Two patients had electrodes implanted in their muscle grafts, and the electrodes were able to record these nerve signals and pass them on to a prosthetic hand in real time.\n\nMORE: Father Uses Scuba Therapy to Restore His Paralyzed Son\u2019s Motor Function\u2014And Now It\u2019s Doing the Same for Others\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, we\u2019ve seen the largest voltage recorded from a nerve compared to all previous results,\u201d Chestek said. \u201cIn previous approaches, you might get 5 microvolts or 50 microvolts\u2014very very small signals. We\u2019ve seen the first ever millivolt signals.\n\n\u201cSo now we can access the signals associated with individual thumb movement, multidegree of freedom thumb movement, individual fingers. This opens up a whole new world for people who are upper limb prosthesis users.\u201d\n\nAnd their interface has already lasted years. Others degrade within months due to scar tissue.\n\nThe future of prosthetics research and industry\n\nThe findings also open up new possibilities for the field, said Chestek, whose expertise is on real-time machine learning algorithms to translate neural signals into movement intent.\n\n\u201cWhat we found is now the nerve signals are good enough to apply the whole world of things we learned in brain control algorithms to nerve control,\u201d she said.\n\nWATCH: Blind Man Develops Smart Cane That Uses Google Maps and Sensors to Identify One\u2019s Surroundings\n\nThe approach generates signals for finer movements than what today\u2019s prosthetic hands are capable of.\n\n\u201cOther research groups have contributed to this as well, but we\u2019ve leapfrogged the capabilities of the prosthetic hands that are currently available. I think this is strong motivation for further developments from prosthetic hand companies,\u201d said Philip Vu, a research fellow in biomedical engineering and first author of the paper.\n\nA clinical trial is ongoing. The team is looking for participants.\n\n\u201cSo many times, the things we do in a research lab add to the knowledge in the field, but you never actually get a chance to see how that impacts a person,\u201d Cederna said. \u201cWhen you can sit and watch one person with a prosthetic device do something that was unthinkable 10 years ago, it is so gratifying. I\u2019m so happy for our participants, and even more happy for all the people in the future that this will help.\u201d\n\nChestek added: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a ways from here, but we\u2019re not going to stop working on this until we can completely restore able-bodied hand movements.

The Gates Foundation\u2019s funding is part of its up to $100 million commitment to the COVID-19 response announced last month.\n\nRELATED: For the First Time, Scientists Have Reversed Dementia in Mice With Drug That Reduces Brain Inflammation\n\nThe foundation\u2019s $100 million commitment is also being used to finance public health responses in the greater Seattle area and protective measures for at-risk populations in Africa.\n\n\u201cViruses like COVID-19 spread rapidly, but the development of vaccines and treatments to stop them moves slowly,\u201d said Mark Suzman, chief executive officer of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \u201cIf we want to make the world safe from outbreaks like COVID-19, particularly for those most vulnerable, then we need to find a way to make research and development move faster. That requires governments, private enterprise, and philanthropic organizations to act quickly to fund R&D.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator will work with the World Health Organization, government and private sector funders and organizations, as well as the global regulatory and policy-setting institutions to focus on drug pipeline development through manufacturing and scale-up. By sharing research, coordinating investments, and pooling resources, these efforts can help to accelerate research.\n\nMORE: FDA Approves the First New Cystic Fibrosis Treatment in Decades\n\nThis kind of collaboration was a key lesson from the 2014 Ebola outbreak. By providing fast and flexible funding at key stages of the development process, the Accelerator will de-risk the pathway for new drugs and biologics for COVID-19 and future epidemic threats, ensuring access in lower-resource countries.\n\nThe COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator will operate jointly as an initiative of the funders, drawing on expertise from inside and outside their organizations, and will also pursue several aspects of the development cycle to streamline the pathway from candidate product to clinical assessment, use, and manufacturing.\n\nTo identify candidate compounds, the Accelerator will take a three-pronged approach: testing approved drugs for activity against COVID-19, screening libraries of thousands of compounds with confirmed safety data, and considering new investigational compounds and monoclonal antibodies. Drugs or monoclonal antibodies that pass initial screening would then be developed by an industry partner.\n\nRELATED: Husband-Wife Duo Has Developed \u2018Gene and Cell Therapy\u2019 Cancer Vaccine Now Being Tested on Patients\n\nThe biotech and pharmaceutical industries will be critical partners, bringing their compound libraries and clinical data to the collaboration and lending commercialization and other expertise that will be required to scale up successful drugs and monoclonal antibodies. In parallel to the development of the COVID-19 drug pipeline, the Accelerator will work with regulators to align criteria and develop manufacturing capacity with industry. An accelerated pathway to bringing effective treatments to patients is around one year for products that have current regulatory approval or candidates with existing clinical data. The timeline would be longer for compounds further upstream in the pipeline that have limited existing clinical data.\n\nDr. Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome said: \u201cScience is moving at a phenomenal pace against COVID-19, but to get ahead of this epidemic we need greater investment and to ensure research co-ordination. The Therapeutics Accelerator will allow us to do this for potential treatments with support for research, development, assessment, and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 is an extremely challenging virus, but we\u2019ve proved that through collaborating across borders we can tackle emerging infectious diseases,\u201d he added. \u201cWe must strive to strengthen efforts in the face of COVID-19, and in doing so, continue to make sure advances are accessible and affordable to all. Investing now, at scale, at risk and as a collective global effort is vital if we are to change the course of this epidemic. We welcome others to join us in this effort.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Success of Advanced-Stage Parkinson\u2019s Treatment is \u2018Beyond Researcher\u2019s Wildest Dreams\u2019\n\nWhile antiviral drugs are approved to lessen the severity of seasonal flu and treat HIV, among other viral diseases, none have demonstrated efficacy against the current epidemic. One reason for the lack of effective treatments is that products may not have an immediate market, which can slow or prevent their research and commercial development. The COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator is designed to help by bringing together resources and expertise to lower the financial and technical risk for academia, biotech, and pharmaceutical companies, while ensuring that these products are accessible and affordable to people in low-resource settings. The expertise of pharmaceutical companies will be critical in identifying, researching, and commercializing successful drugs.\n\nProtect Yourself From Pessimism By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "Taking Hot Baths Every Day is Linked to Lower Risk of Stroke or Heart Disease", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/daily-hot-baths-linked-to-lower-risk-of-death/", "date": "2020-4-8", "transcript": "Regular tub bathing is linked to a lower risk of death from heart disease and stroke\u2014and the higher the \u201cdose,\u201d the better it seems to be for cardiovascular health, with a daily hot bath seemingly more protective than taking a bath once or twice a week.\n\nAccording to the long-term study published online in the journal Heart last month, having a bath is associated with good sleep quality and better self-rated health, but it\u2019s not clear what its long-term impact might be on cardiovascular disease risk, including heart attack, sudden cardiac death, and stroke.\n\nThe health benefits of taking hot baths are similar to those experienced by Finnish adults who regularly sauna bathe\u2014although additional research has also found that sauna bathing can positively affect everything from neurocognitive diseases and mental health disorders to skin diseases, arthritis, headaches, flu, and even overall mortality.\n\nTo explore the benefits of hot baths further, the researchers drew on participants in The Japan Public Health Center based Study Cohort 1, a population based tracking study of more than 61,000 middle-aged adults (45 to 59 years).\n\nRELATED: 30 Years of Research Shows Sauna Bathing is Game-Changer for Longevity and Heart Disease\n\nAt the start of the study in 1990, some 43,000 participants completed a detailed questionnaire on their bathing habits and potentially influential factors: lifestyle, to include exercise, diet, alcohol intake, weight (BMI); average sleep duration; and medical history and current medicines use.\n\nEach participant was monitored until death or completion of the study at the end of December 2009, whichever came first, with the final analysis based on 30,076 people.\n\nDuring the monitoring period, 2,097 cases of cardiovascular disease occurred: 275 heart attacks; 53 sudden cardiac deaths; and 1,769 strokes.\n\nMORE: Give Yourself a Break\u2014New Research Says Kicking Back in a Sauna Has Surprising Health Benefits\n\nAfter taking account of potentially influential factors, analysis of the data showed that compared with a once or twice weekly bath or no bath at all, a daily hot bath was associated with a 28% lower overall risk of cardiovascular disease, and a 26% lower overall risk of stroke.\n\nThe frequency of tub bathing wasn\u2019t associated with a heightened risk of sudden cardiac death, or with a particular type of stroke, called subarachnoid haemorrhage (bleed into the space surrounding the brain).\n\nFurther analysis of preferred water temperature indicated 26% lower and 35% lower risks of overall cardiovascular disease for warm and hot water, respectively. But no significant associations emerged for overall stroke risk and water temperature.\n\nCHECK OUT: These are the 3 Most Promising Longevity Supplements From Scientific Research So Far\n\nAfter excluding those participants who developed cardiovascular disease within 5 or 10 years of the start of the study, the associations found weren\u2019t quite as strong, but nevertheless still remained statistically significant.\n\nThis is an observational study, and as such, can\u2019t establish cause, added to which changes in bathing frequency weren\u2019t tracked during the monitoring period. The typical style of Japanese bathing also includes immersion to shoulder height, and this may be a critical factor.\n\nBut, say the researchers, previously published research has pointed to a link between heat exposure and cardiovascular disease prevention: this is because the effects of heat on the body are not dissimilar to those of exercise.\n\nRELATED: Largest Study of Its Kind Identifies the Surprising Health Benefits of Fasting Every Other Day\n\n\u201cWe found that frequent tub bathing was significantly associated with a lower risk of hypertension, suggesting that a beneficial effect of tub bathing on risk of [cardiovascular disease] may in part be due to a reduced risk of developing hypertension,\u201d write the researchers.\n\nThey acknowledge that taking a hot bath is not without its risk, particularly if the temperature is too high, a point that is taken up by Dr. Andrew Felix Burden in a linked editorial.\n\nReprinted from BMJ\n\nBe Sure And Share This Heart-Handy Research With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "CO2 Emissions From Global Power Sector Declined By Record-Breaking 2% in 2019, Says New Research", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/emissions-from-power-sector-decline-by-2-percent-in-2019/", "date": "2020-3-10", "transcript": "Carbon emissions from the world\u2019s power sector reportedly fell by 2% in 2019\u2014the single largest drop in electrical CO2 production since 1990.\n\nAccording to a new report from environmental think tank Ember, the historic decline in CO2 emissions was largely caused by Europe and the US shifting away from coal, resulting in a global 3% decline in coal-fired power generation, which is also the largest drop in 30 years.\n\nCoal usage in Europe declined by 24% in favor of wind and solar power while coal declined in the US by 16% in favor of natural gas. Collectively, this means that Europe\u2019s coal usage has been almost halved by 43% since 2007.\n\n\u201cThe global decline of coal and power sector emissions is good news for the climate but governments have to dramatically accelerate the electricity transition so that global coal generation collapses throughout the 2020s,\u201d says Ember Electrical Analyst Dave Jones. \u201cTo switch from coal into gas is just swapping one fossil fuel for another. The cheapest and quickest way to end coal generation is through a rapid roll-out of wind and solar.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Whales Represent One of the Greatest Allies Against Climate Change\u2014Perhaps Even More Than Trees\n\nThis year\u2019s edition of Ember\u2019s annual emissions report uses data representing electrical generation and demand across 217 countries, covering 85% of the world\u2019s electricity production. The full report is free for public access.\n\nThe report\u2019s key findings go on to say: \u201cWind and solar generation rose by 15% in 2019, generating 8% of the world\u2019s electricity. Compound growth rate of 15% of wind and solar generation is needed every year to meet the Paris climate agreement. This was achieved in 2019 and lower prices provide hope it can be sustained.\n\n\u201cHowever, maintaining this high growth rate as volumes scale up will require a concerted effort from all regions.\u201d\n\nRELATED: This Tasty Seaweed Reduces Cow Emissions by 99%\u2014and It Could Soon Be a Climate Gamechanger\n\nThe report goes hand-in-hand with research published by the International Energy Agency last month outlining how global CO2 emissions had actually defied expectations by plateauing in 2019 thanks to a rise in renewable power sources and declining coal usage.\n\nThe United States recorded the largest emissions decline on a country basis, with a fall of 140 million tons, or 2.9%. US emissions are now down by almost 1 gigaton from their peak in 2000.\n\nLOOK: Rather Than End Up in a Landfill, Non-Recyclable Glass May Soon Be a Cheaper New Ingredient in Concrete\n\nEmissions in the European Union fell by 160 million tons, or 5%, in 2019 driven by reductions in the power sector. Natural gas produced more electricity than coal for the first time ever, meanwhile wind-powered electricity nearly caught up with coal-fired electricity.\n\nJapan\u2019s emissions fell by 45 million tons, or around 4%\u2014the fastest pace of decline since 2009, as output from recently restarted nuclear reactors increased.\n\nPower Up With Positivity By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}, {"title": "The Latest Positive COVID Updates From Quarantine: A Pandemic-Positive Podcast With Geri & Anthony (Ep #4)", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/good-news-gurus-podcast-quarantine-edition-4/", "date": "2020-3-24", "transcript": "Listen and Subscribe to Episodes on iTunes\u2014or Spotify, here \u2014 Or, on Podbean\u2026\n\nEpisode #4 of our quarantine-inspired Good News Gurus podcast dropped March 23: Geri and Anthony discussed the huge companies donating emergency supplies of masks; a breakthrough surgery that removed a man\u2019s lung to clean it, and placed it right back again; plus hilarious descriptions of quarantines using only 6 words (and much more uplifting news, including magician David Minkin giving away free Skype shows for sick people).\n\nListen and Subscribe to Episodes on iTunes\u2014or Spotify, here \u2014 Or, on Podbean\u2026\n\nEMAIL us to be on the show or share good news: [email protected]\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the Good News Morning Email: gnn.to/jolt\n\nREVIEW and Subscribe to the show on iTunes\u2014or on Podbean.", "source": "goodnewsnetwork.org"}]
